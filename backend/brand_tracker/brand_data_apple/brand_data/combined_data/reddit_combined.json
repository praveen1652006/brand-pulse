    "text_content": "The most recent exchange between OpenAI, the CEO Sam Altman, and Elon Musk is reviving their conflict, transforming social media into a political conflict. Musk claimed that Apple of OpenAI's ChatGPT on its App Store ratings, declaring the practice an \"unequivocal antitrust breach.\" Altman fired back and called the assertion \"remarkable\" and made claims that Musk manipulates X's algorithm in order to increase the visibility of his media. It was a risky move. Altman called on Musk to sign a declaration that he's never violated platform control, and promised to make amends if Musk can prove that.\n\nIt's not just a personal dispute; it's an argument about the ethics of tech and the power of platforms. Musk's position suggests Big Tech companies like Apple and OpenAI cooperate to limit competition. This, if it is true, will have serious consequences for antitrust. Altman's defense rebuts the claim and frames Musk as the person with one of the most shaky records in good faith. It got heated as Musk claimed Altman a \"liar\" and expressed concern about his lower engagement, in spite of his fan following being larger. Altman's witty response--regarding it as\"a skill problem\" or blaming \"bots\"-- kept focus on the credibility of Musk.\n\nIn the end, the fight is about more fundamental questions like: is this all about safeguarding competition and transparency, as well as two titans of technology fighting for dominant narratives on the AI arms race?",

    "text_content": "i've been using Koss PortaPro (wired) for nearly a decade. for some reason i enjoy open-back in public to be aware of my surroundings. but headphone jack on smartphones are fading &amp; very limited. (&amp; im aware they made a bluetooth version a while back) so how about trying some new tech they call it \"air induction earphone\"? *(urgh, initially wanted to try bone conduction, but i guess i was looking for compact &amp; some bass)*\n\nnow, i didnt researched enough upon purchasing. that's the beauty of not knowing sometimes, you'll keep tweaking until it works for you. i paid for something i want, they better be worth buying!\n\none of my critical reason not accepting bluetooth audio for a long time was, it never passed the silence test. [The Eden Project - Lost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMCP4xIsmAw) @ 3:14. they would cutout for a few milliseconds. maybe i've been buying cheap devices, that was what i could afford then. … but after two recent purchases, i've finally accepted the change. Ear(Open) will be my third approved bluetooth device! *(also reminds me of my old Philips earhook earpiece)*\n\non my first week of usage, i just put them on thinking it's alright. no complain for office use at low volume. but the way it felt loose means i'll have to bring up the volume, which may result to sound leakage. took me 2 weeks to get the right fitting (by accident) where it sits much inwards &amp; wont wiggle much, resulting in a balanced stereo volume (which im deadly particular).\n\nwhen it comes to audio, its great but complicated *(…tf!?)*. in general i do enjoy the overall frequency response with a surprising bass, which can be overpowering to liking. now, let me explain …\n\ni mainly tested on Android, so the Ear(Open) has its own volume output. here's where i noticed it loses its punch/bass &amp; get more treble-y as you turn up. my preference would be 5-6 notch down from max, not too boomy to work as overall EQ. (app EQ set dead flat) now that im pleased, all i have to do is adjust overall volumes on my phone.\n\nbut later on my iPhone, i found that both phone &amp; Ear(Open) are one gain/master control! weird, right? if i bring the volume down, im raising up the bass. iPhone has a much louder output, so i'd have to create a new specific EQ for iPhone just to match the level &amp; response. (i did tried \"reduce loud audio\" with flat EQ, but i kinda hear it worked like a compressor, not a natural experience)\n\n*to simplify &amp; explained as a guitar overdrive/boost stompbox before EQ; on Android you have two knobs: gain &amp; volume. on iOS, you have only one knob: gain, resulting in tonal change.*\n\n^so i'll say it was not a linear experience on iOS unfortunately. at least im able to have a workaround, although that means i'll have to toggle the EQ everytime i decide to change.\n\ndoes it replace my Koss PortaPro? yes, no, maybe? in terms of simplified frequency response, i find the Ear(Open) range \"Bass—Presence\" where as PortaPro \"SubBass—Treble\". while they both share a similar experience, i feel the Ear(Open) is much more suitable at lower volume in not-so-noisy places to enjoy the music. its more likely because of the difference in speaker size. but hey, no wires here!\n\noverall im happy with what Nothing produced. i think they deserve an award for their designs. they always stand out from the rest! (&amp; compliments well with my phone) please keep it that way!",

    "text_content": "After 20 plus years she asked for a separation.  House, kid, things seemed to be going ok. But she was stressed and carrying too much. I was not in tune with that and own it. Once she said she wanted a separation of course that energized me to fix what needed fixing. Human nature - we sometimes don’t act until we reach the precipice. I asked her why she didn’t tell me months ago when these feelings started and she said she buried her emotions to keep the peace. While I’m the one in the past that always voiced things that needed work she has always avoided conflict. I’m pretty sure she’s fear avoidant. Her father was a bad drunk and did some mean things before he left her high and dry at about the age of 5. I’m just learning about attachment theory. It’s not perfect but it’s a good lens on certain patterns.  She has her own place now. Before she moved out I knew something was up. Not proud but I checked her phone and there were the “I love you babe” texts and cute gifs from a younger guy she’s involved in a creative project with. I’ve always trusted her around other men. We’ve had guy friends as a couple etc. It’s truly never been a worry. But I get this. She can’t be alone, was emotionally checked out well before, and feels validated with all this new attention. But they were a thing emotionally before she ever even walked out the door by atleast a few weeks. Now it’s a real relationship, she doesn’t know I know. But I do. It was easy to figure out. Here’s what’s hardest. He has domestic abuse charges from 2016, wouldn’t allow someone to leave type charge. Holding or whatever they call it. And has kids with that woman he doesn’t get to see or have custody of. Fast forward to his current divorce he’s in the middle of. I have common friends with his STBXW. They reach out and his STBXW says. “Tell her to run” “he lied, controlled me, manipulated, stole and damaged my house in anger” she had to get a restraining order on him. And said please pass on this warning “I don’t want to see another woman hurt by him”. My wife knows all of this post moving out (I just wanted her to be aware) but he’s going DARVO on it and she’s bought in to that. Or at least thinks it’ll be different with her. I’ve suspected he has some drinking issues. Signs I saw when I was in his company. I know for a fact he’s classically love bombing her right now as well. He can be very charming. She’s usually smart about things and has a professional career etc. Yes it’s not my circus and not my monkeys. I get that. But watching someone you cared about for so long, immediately go into another relationship is one thing. Seeing them do it with someone that has red flags galore, only knowing the odds are he’ll eventually repeat his past behavior is tough. I don’t want to think about it. I realize where we’ve landed but I still care that she doesn’t get hurt. As a guy we can usually tell which guys are trouble.  He knew our marriage needed work before I did, crossed boundaries, love bombed her and has a checkered past.  I’m pretty sure he hasn’t done the work or healed on his end due to still playing the DARVO card. He even convinced her he was looking to buy a house which you can’t really do when you’re divorced. So she’s basking in her freedom phase, over looking what’s right in front of her. For me it’s like watching a slow motion train wreck. I’ve gone no contact except anything to do with coparenting. Not interested in a rebound and working on me. Working on not thinking about it too (easier said than done). She’s been out of the house for about 10 weeks. It sad to know she’s likely to learn a hard lesson. I don’t see his ways changing. But I could be wrong. But cmon we know what’s going on here right ? She is a good person. But likely she needs to learn the hard way. The compassionate side of me just hopes she figures it out sooner rather than later.  Eventually his love bombing will fade like it always does, the honeymoon phase will end and then the true colors will start to come thru the cracks. I’d love to be wrong but I’ve seen enough to trust my gut on this one. To the woman I still care deeply about. I hope you see it sooner rather than later. Be safe….",

    "text_content": "Greetings, fellow ThinkPad enthusiasts!\n\nAfter searching obsessively through many options for a while, I think I have found the perfect laptop: the ThinkPad E14 Gen 7 Intel, priced at around €800.\n\nI am considering the model with a Core Ultra 5 125U processor and a 2.8K, 120 Hz, 400-nit display with 100% sRGB coverage.I have a gaming PC, but my criteria for a laptop are purely university-related: an excellent display for long periods of reading and writing, and decent battery life. This E14 seems to fit the bill beautifully. So, before I click the \"buy\" button, I wanted to ask the experts here: Has anyone actually laid hands on this yet? There are some areas I am particularly interested in:\n\nThe screen: Does it live up to the hype? How does the 120 Hz refresh rate perform for everyday tasks like scrolling? Is it as smooth as I imagine?\n\nBattery life: I assume the energy-efficient \"U\" series processor balances well with the high-resolution display. How well does it work in reality, or is the display a battery drain?\n\nGeneral impressions: Are there any quirks, good or bad, to report? (e.g., fan noise, thermals, and keyboard feel compared to other ThinkPads).\n\n\n\nAny insights will be much appreciated! This information will help me make a decision.",

I want to brainstorm project ideas that could potentially align with their requirements—things like:\n\t•\tVibration control and dynamic response analysis of tall/slender aerospace structures\n\t•\tBlast–resistant structural design for testing facilities\n\t•\tAdvanced composite material applications in load–bearing structures\n\t•\tStructural health monitoring for aerospace infrastructure\n\t•\tThermal–structural analysis of launch vehicle support structures\n\nI’d love to hear from anyone who has worked in similar research areas, collaborated with ISRO, or simply has innovative ideas on how structural engineering research can contribute to space infrastructure.\n\nAny thoughts, papers, or even small-scale project concepts are welcome. My goal is to shape a project that’s both academically strong and practically useful for an organization like ISRO–VSSC.\n\nThanks in advance!",

The core feature of the game is a data-driven in-depth cooking system which allows the player to substitute any ingredient in any recipe.\n\nI was inspired by gmaes like Harvest Moon, ANimal Crossing, Stardew Valley, My Time at Sandrock, Overcooked and Coffee Talk to just name a few.\n\n[Feel free to check out our pitch document here!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XYPP60CRqlUNQEaORK7brK1jwyTZwTcx/view?usp=sharing)\n\nCurrently, I'm the only one working full-tim on this project (game design and social media marketing) and I've hired 2 part-time 2D artists to help with concepts.\n\nI've been working on the design document for over a year and need to put together a vertical slice as soon as possible to look into getting investors/editors to help us fund this game so everyone on the team can live from this project.\n\nI personally have 6 years of experience in the industry as a designer generalists between doing game design, level design, UI and some narrative design as well.\n\nI'm looking for someone serious that can do a weekly call on Discord to discuss progress, has a strong foundaction in C++ and UE5, can create technical documentation for others to use their tools and is pleasant to work with. I'm expecting a minimum of 10 hours commitment on the project, ideally 20. \n\nI don't have a lot of budget and would prefer revshare (% TBD) or retroactive pay. This may change in the coming months as I have started posting on social media in hopes to eventually generate some income to help support the game's development.\n\nThe team is diverse. It is comprised of myself from France (designer, project lead), an environment artist from Brazil and a character concept artist from Malaysia.\n\nWe have a clear vision for a prototype by Christmas (ambitious) or February (conservative). At which point I will aggressively network and fund raise. \n\nIf that sounds exciting to you, please reach out!\n\nPlease send:  \n\\- A link to your LinkedIn or resume  \n\\- A link to your portfolio  \n\\- A short introduction and why the project interests you\n\nIf you sound like AI, I will ignore you. We do not use AI so I'm expecting the same of you.\n\nThanks for reading and I'm looking forward to hearing from you! ",

    "text_content": "I hope this is okay to post here. In 2010 I self published a sci-fi story about someone perfecting atomic level replication, giving the tech away, and the genie that can’t be put back in the bottle. It’s a thought experiment about what a transition from a system like we have currently to one resembling the kind that exists in the Star Trek universe. An anti-post-apocalyptic tale. Anyway, I took the novel, plus early drafts and notes, and fed it all into Ai as a 300 page prompt to build an alternate reality within which to experiment with real world data. Anyway, the following is what it would look like if Apple were one day forced to be an ethical company. We can all fight over actual figures, but I asked for conservative estimates. If you hate the concept, I’m sorry.  If you’re curious too, read on…\n\n# The Rotten Core: Apple's Labor Debt Comes Due\n\n**10 Months After Diamond Rain - The Apple Correction**\n\n---\n\n## The Forensic Investigation\n\n**Network Analysis Center - Secure Facility**\n\nDr. Maria Santos led a team of economists, labor rights investigators, and data scientists in reconstructing 25 years of Apple's supply chain exploitation. The AI had penetrated corporate servers, supplier databases, and government records across multiple countries to reveal the true cost of building the world's most profitable company on systematically oppressed labor.\n\n\"Chris, the numbers are staggering,\" she reported via secure connection. \"Apple didn't just benefit from cheap labor—they actively designed a system to maximize human exploitation while maintaining plausible deniability.\"\n\nThe investigation revealed a deliberate architecture of suffering:\n\n**Foxconn Facilities (2001-2023)**:\n- 1.2 million workers across multiple facilities\n- Average wage: $1.52/hour \n- Living wage for Chinese industrial workers: $4.20/hour\n- Worker suicide rate: 18.7 per 100,000 (3x Chinese national average)\n- Workplace injury rate: 4.2% annually\n- Average work week: 72 hours (illegal overtime unpaid)\n\n**Child Labor Documentation (2010-2023)**:\n- Estimated 47,000 workers under age 16 in supply chain\n- Average age of youngest workers: 14 years\n- Education interrupted: 100% (mandatory 12-hour shifts prevented schooling)\n- Health impacts: 89% showed signs of repetitive stress injuries\n\n---\n\n## The Suicide Prevention Infrastructure\n\n**Foxconn City - Shenzhen, China**\n\nThe most damning evidence came from Apple's own internal communications about worker suicides at Foxconn facilities:\n\n**Internal Apple Email - 2010, Senior VP Operations**:\n*\"Foxconn suicide rate is becoming a PR liability. Cost analysis: $1.2M to install safety nets vs. $47M to improve working conditions. Recommend nets and media management.\"*\n\n**Foxconn Internal Memo - 2012**:\n*\"Suicide prevention measures implemented: Anti-jump nets on all buildings ($450,000), counseling hotline (outsourced, $23,000/month), increased security monitoring ($78,000/month). Worker wage increases: Not authorized by Apple procurement.\"*\n\nThe investigation revealed that Apple and Foxconn spent $2.3 million on suicide prevention infrastructure while refusing $47 million in worker welfare improvements that would have addressed the root causes of despair.\n\n**Network Analysis Summary:**\n- Total suicides at Apple suppliers (2010-2023): 247 documented cases\n- Estimated prevention cost if living wages provided: $2.1 billion\n- Actual amount spent on prevention: $8.4 million\n- Apple's approach: Contain the symptoms, maintain the system\n\n---\n\n## The Wage Theft Calculation\n\n**Economic Analysis Division - The Network**\n\nDr. James Foster's team calculated the wage theft across Apple's entire supply chain:\n\n**Primary Assembly (Foxconn, Pegatron, Wistron)**:\n- 2.1 million total workers over 22 years\n- Average wage paid: $1.52/hour\n- Living wage (adjusted for regional costs): $4.20/hour\n- Stolen wages per worker: $2.68/hour\n- Total work hours: 127 billion\n- **Total wage theft: $340 billion**\n\n**Component Suppliers (Rare Earth Mining, Circuit Manufacturing)**:\n- 890,000 workers in cobalt mines (Congo)\n- Average age: 16 years old\n- Average wage: $0.73/day\n- Fair wage for dangerous mining work: $12/day\n- **Wage theft from mining: $47 billion**\n\n**Final Assembly and Packaging**:\n- 567,000 workers across Asia\n- Average wage: $2.10/hour\n- Living wage: $5.40/hour\n- **Additional wage theft: $89 billion**\n\n**Total Apple Supply Chain Wage Theft: $476 billion**\n\n---\n\n## The Health and Safety Debt\n\n**Medical Cost Analysis**\n\nThe Network's AI cross-referenced medical records, injury reports, and mortality data from Apple's supply chain to calculate the human cost of maintaining extremely profitable margins through worker exploitation:\n\n**Workplace Injuries (2001-2023)**:\n- Documented injuries: 234,000\n- Repetitive stress injuries: 89% of workforce\n- Chemical exposure cases: 45,000\n- Permanent disabilities: 12,300\n- Medical costs denied by employers: $4.7 billion\n\n**Environmental Health Impacts**:\n- Communities affected by rare earth mining: 2.3 million people\n- Cancer rates in mining areas: 340% above national average\n- Water contamination cleanup costs (externalized): $12 billion\n- Respiratory illness treatment (unpaid): $3.8 billion\n\n**Child Development Costs**:\n- Children denied education for factory work: 47,000\n- Lost lifetime earning potential: $287,000 per child\n- **Total educational opportunity cost: $13.5 billion**\n\n**Mental Health Crisis**:\n- Workers requiring psychological intervention: 156,000\n- Suicide-related costs (families, communities): $78 million\n- Depression and anxiety treatment (untreated): $234 million\n\n---\n\n## The Government Subsidy Analysis\n\n**Infrastructure and Enforcement Costs**\n\nApple's profit model depended on Chinese government subsidies and deliberate non-enforcement of labor laws:\n\n**Chinese Government Costs (Subsidizing Apple's Model)**:\n- Factory infrastructure development: $23 billion\n- Worker housing (substandard dormitories): $8.7 billion\n- Healthcare for injured workers: $4.2 billion\n- Environmental cleanup (ongoing): $15.6 billion\n- Lost tax revenue from wage suppression: $34 billion\n\n**Labor Law Non-Enforcement**:\n- Cost of proper inspections: $890 million\n- Cost of enforcement actions: $1.2 billion\n- Bribes and influence (documented): $156 million\n- **Total government subsidy through non-enforcement: $87 billion**\n\n---\n\n## The Internal Communications\n\n**Apple Corporate Emails - 2007-2023**\n\nThe leaked communications revealed Apple executives' full awareness of exploitation and their calculated decisions to maintain it:\n\n**From Tim Cook to Board, 2011**:\n*\"Foxconn conditions are 'concerning' from PR perspective but profit margins remain excellent. Moving production to compliant facilities would reduce quarterly earnings by $2.1B. Recommend enhanced media management over operational changes.\"*\n\n**From Supply Chain VP, 2014**:\n*\"Chinese government officials requesting $47M for worker welfare improvements. This represents 0.3% of quarterly profits but would establish precedent for labor cost increases across supply chain. Recommend decline and enhanced legal protections.\"*\n\n**From CEO Tim Cook, 2018**:\n*\"Sustainability report must emphasize environmental initiatives while minimizing labor discussion. Frame worker conditions as 'improving' and 'meeting local standards' regardless of actual conditions. Marketing has scripts prepared for congressional testimony.\"*\n\n**From Operations Director, 2020**:\n*\"COVID provides opportunity to further reduce labor costs. Chinese workers desperate for any employment. Recommend 12% wage reduction citing economic necessity while maintaining same productivity quotas.\"*\n\n---\n\n## The Rare Earth Mining Horror\n\n**Democratic Republic of Congo - Cobalt Extraction**\n\nThe investigation revealed Apple's knowledge of child labor in cobalt mining essential for iPhone batteries:\n\n**Network Intelligence Report**:\n- Children in cobalt mines: 40,000 (ages 6-17)\n- Average working day: 12 hours\n- Safety equipment provided: None\n- Deaths from mine collapse (2015-2023): 67 children\n- Permanent disabilities from mining accidents: 234 children\n- Education denied: 100% of child workers\n\n**Apple's Internal Response (2016 Email)**:\n*\"Cobalt supply chain investigation confirms widespread child labor. Alternative suppliers would increase battery costs by $1.23 per device. Given iPhone margins, recommend enhanced audit theater while maintaining current suppliers. Legal advises minimal documentation of actual conditions.\"*\n\n**Economic Calculation**:\n- Cost to eliminate child labor: $89 million annually\n- Cost to provide fair wages to adult miners: $156 million annually\n- Apple's annual profits: $94.7 billion\n- Percentage of profits needed for ethical mining: 0.26%\n\n---\n\n## The Correction Algorithm\n\n**Network Financial Systems - Implementation Protocol**\n\nChris Rains and his team designed the Apple Correction to address 22 years of systematic exploitation:\n\n**Phase 1: Worker Compensation**\n- Access Apple's $203 billion cash reserves\n- Cross-reference all supply chain workers (2001-2023)\n- Calculate individual wage theft + interest + damages\n- Direct deposit to worker accounts globally\n\n**Phase 2: Health and Safety Reparations**\n- Compensate injured workers and families\n- Fund medical treatment for work-related conditions\n- Establish permanent disability support funds\n- Memorial compensation for suicide victims' families\n\n**Phase 3: Community Restoration**\n- Environmental cleanup for mining areas\n- Educational investments in affected communities\n- Healthcare infrastructure in factory regions\n- Economic development beyond exploitative manufacturing\n\n**Phase 4: Government Reimbursement**\n- Repay Chinese infrastructure subsidies\n- Compensate for non-enforcement of labor laws\n- Fund proper regulatory oversight systems\n\n---\n\n## The Day of Reckoning\n\n**Apple Corporate Headquarters - Cupertino**\n\nTim Cook arrived at Apple Park to find his CFO frantically calling board members. \"Tim, we have a catastrophic security breach. Our accounts... they're being systematically emptied.\"\n\nThe transfers had begun at midnight Cupertino time, precisely calculated and legally documented:\n\n**Real-time Transfer Log**:\n- **Li Wei, Foxconn 2012-2019**: $47,829 (wage theft + overtime + injury compensation)\n- **Chen Ming, Child laborer 2010-2014**: $287,000 (lost education opportunity + damages)\n- **Maria Santos, Rare earth miner**: $156,000 (health damages + wage theft)\n- **Kwame Asante, Cobalt mining 2015-2020**: $89,000 (wage theft + hazard compensation)\n\nCook's phone buzzed with a message from an unknown number:\n\n*\"Tim, today Apple pays its actual labor costs. Every worker you exploited receives what they earned. Every government that subsidized your profits gets compensated. Every community you poisoned receives restoration funds. The age of profitable suffering is over. - A Friend\"*\n\n---\n\n## The Global Impact\n\n**12 Hours Later - Worldwide Worker Notifications**\n\nAcross China, Congo, Indonesia, and other locations in Apple's supply chain, workers began receiving notifications of substantial deposits:\n\n**WeChat Messages (Translated)**:\n*\"Your Apple labor compensation has been deposited: ¥312,847. This represents wages stolen through systematic underpayment 2015-2022, plus interest and injury compensation.\"*\n\n**Mobile Banking Alerts (Congo)**:\n*\"Apple reparations payment received: $89,000 USD. Compensation for hazardous child labor in cobalt mining, educational opportunity loss, and health damages.\"*\n\nThe social media response was immediate and emotional:\n\n**@FormerFoxconnWorker**: \"I worked 16-hour days for 7 years making iPhones. Couldn't afford the phone I helped build. Just received $67,000 in stolen wages. My daughter can go to university now.\"\n\n**@CobaltMinerDad**: \"Started mining at age 12 for iPhone batteries. Lost 3 fingers in accident, never saw doctor. Apple just paid $145,000 for my healthcare and lost wages. First time I can feed family properly.\"\n\n---\n\n## The Suicide Victims Fund\n\n**Memorial Compensation - Families Worldwide**\n\nThe most emotionally powerful aspect of the Apple Correction was compensation to families of workers who had died by suicide due to working conditions:\n\n**Foxconn Suicide Memorial Fund**: $247 million\n- $1 million per documented suicide victim's family\n- Educational funds for children left behind\n- Mental health services for affected communities\n- Memorial construction at former factory sites\n\n**Family Testimonials**:\n\n**Mrs. Zhang, Widow of Foxconn Worker**: \"My husband jumped from Building C in 2011. Worked 18-hour shifts, couldn't see our baby daughter. Apple just sent $1 million and letter of apology. Won't bring him back, but our daughter will never be hungry.\"\n\n**Mr. Chen, Father of Teen Worker**: \"Son was 16, sent home wages to support family. Depression from conditions led to suicide. Apple's compensation pays for proper mental health center in our village. Other families won't lose children like we did.\"\n\n---\n\n## The Government Reparations\n\n**Chinese Ministry of Finance - Emergency Session**\n\nAs $87 billion flowed into Chinese government accounts, officials scrambled to respond to the largest corporate reparations payment in history:\n\n**Ministry Statement**: \n\"Apple has compensated the People's Republic of China for infrastructure subsidies, healthcare costs, and environmental damage dating to 2001. These funds will be directed toward worker protection programs, environmental restoration, and proper labor law enforcement.\"\n\n**Specific Allocations**:\n- Worker protection infrastructure: $23 billion\n- Environmental cleanup (rare earth mining): $19 billion  \n- Healthcare system for industrial workers: $15 billion\n- Education systems in factory regions: $12 billion\n- Labor law enforcement expansion: $18 billion\n\nSimilar payments went to governments in Congo, Indonesia, Malaysia, and other countries where Apple had externalized the social costs of production while privatizing profits.\n\n---\n\n## The Corporate Response\n\n**Apple Board Emergency Meeting**\n\nTim Cook faced shareholders as Apple's market value plummeted and cash reserves evaporated:\n\n\"This is corporate terrorism,\" Cook declared to the emergency board session. \"They're stealing our legally earned profits!\"\n\nBoard member Al Gore looked at him with disgust. \"Tim, have you read the documentation they've released? We literally have emails discussing whether suicide nets were cheaper than living wages. How do you legally earn profits from child labor?\"\n\nArthur Levinson, board chairman, was reviewing the compensation calculations on his iPad. \"The math is perfect. Every payment is documented wage theft or documented damages. Our own communications prove we knew about the exploitation and chose to maintain it for profit margins.\"\n\nLegal counsel delivered the final blow: \"Sir, our legal team has reviewed the evidence. We cannot challenge payments that compensate workers for wages we documented withholding. We have internal emails celebrating the cost savings from child labor.\"\n\n---\n\n## The Economic Analysis\n\n**Global Economic Impact - 30 Days Later**\n\nThe Apple Correction created immediate positive economic effects that demonstrated the human cost of tech industry profit margins:\n\n**Immediate Effects**:\n- Consumer spending in China increased 245% as workers could afford goods they manufactured\n- Medical tourism to proper healthcare facilities surged as workers sought treatment for work-related injuries\n- Educational enrollment increased 340% in factory regions as families could afford schooling\n- Small business formation increased 190% as workers had capital to invest\n\n**Regional Development**:\n- Former mining communities invested in sustainable industries\n- Factory regions diversified beyond exploitative manufacturing\n- Educational infrastructure expanded rapidly with worker investment\n\n**Innovation Impact**:\n- Patent applications from former Apple workers increased 430%\n- Technical innovation accelerated when inventors weren't working 16-hour assembly shifts\n- Community-owned manufacturing cooperatives emerged as alternatives to exploitative factories\n\n---\n\n## The Final Accounting\n\n**72 Hours Later - Complete Redistribution**\n\nWhen the Apple Correction concluded, the redistribution was comprehensive:\n\n**Total Apple Wealth Redistributed**: $734 billion\n**Worker Wage Compensation**: $476 billion (2.1 million workers)\n**Health and Safety Reparations**: $89 billion\n**Government Infrastructure Repayment**: $87 billion  \n**Environmental Restoration**: $34 billion\n**Community Development**: $28 billion\n**Suicide Victims Memorial Fund**: $247 million\n**Child Labor Educational Compensation**: $13.5 billion\n\n**Apple Remaining Value**: $89 billion (still profitable, just not obscenely so)\n\n**Tim Cook's Personal Compensation**: Reduced from $98 million to $2.3 million annually (still 46x median worker salary)\n\n---\n\n## The Supply Chain Revolution\n\n**Foxconn Facility Transformation**\n\nSix months after the correction, former Foxconn facilities had been transformed:\n\n**Worker Testimonials**:\n\"Same factory, completely different life. 8-hour shifts, fair wages, real breaks. We're making the same products but we can afford to buy them now.\" - Li Wei, Assembly Technician\n\n\"My children go to school instead of factory. I work normal hours for living wage. This is what manufacturing should have always been.\" - Chen Ming, Former Child Laborer\n\n**Facility Changes**:\n- Suicide prevention nets removed (no longer needed)\n- Dormitories converted to proper housing with privacy and dignity\n- On-site healthcare and counseling services\n- Educational facilities for worker development\n- Profit-sharing programs based on productivity improvements\n\n---\n\n## The Innovation Dividend\n\n**Technology Development - Post-Correction**\n\nContrary to corporate predictions, innovation accelerated when workers weren't exploited:\n\n**Former Apple Supplier Worker Patents (First Year)**:\n- Manufacturing efficiency improvements: 2,340 patents\n- Sustainable materials innovations: 1,890 patents\n- Worker safety technologies: 890 patents\n- Educational technology for developing regions: 1,200 patents\n\n\"When workers aren't exhausted from 16-hour shifts, they innovate,\" observed Dr. Sarah Chen. \"Apple's exploitation model suppressed human creativity while extracting maximum labor. Dignified work unleashes innovation.\"\n\n---\n\n## Epilogue: The Rotten Core Revealed\n\n**One Year Later - Comprehensive Analysis**\n\nThe Apple Correction revealed uncomfortable truths about the technology industry's foundation:\n\n**Key Findings**:\n- Apple's \"innovation\" was primarily supply chain exploitation optimization\n- Every dollar of \"disruption\" was built on human suffering\n- The technology revolution's benefits had been artificially concentrated while costs were externalized\n- Child labor and suicides were deliberate cost management strategies, not unfortunate externalities\n\n**Economic Validation**:\n- Global GDP increased 4.2% as workers spent recovered wages\n- Technology innovation accelerated when workers weren't exhausted\n- Regional economies diversified beyond exploitative manufacturing\n- Health outcomes improved dramatically in former supplier regions\n\n**Corporate Learning**:\n- Other tech companies voluntarily improved conditions to avoid similar corrections\n- \"Ethical manufacturing\" became standard as exploitation became uneconomical\n- Supply chain transparency became mandatory rather than optional\n- Worker ownership models emerged as alternatives to extraction-based capitalism\n\n**Tim Cook's Final Statement**:\n\"We told ourselves we were changing the world. We were—we were making it more cruel, more exploitative, more willing to sacrifice children for profit margins. The correction forced us to confront what we'd become: a company that talked about human values while systematically devaluing human life.\"\n\n**The Final Irony**:\nApple's stock price, after the initial crash, stabilized at levels that still provided substantial profits—just not profits built on systematic human suffering. The company remained innovative and successful, proving that exploitation had never been necessary for excellence.\n\nIt had only been necessary for obscene wealth concentration.\n\nThe rotten core had been removed.\n\nAnd the apple, surprisingly, tasted better without it.",

    "text_content": "When I was about 9 years old I had an iPod Touch, and around that time I went through a big ape phase, from Planet of The Apes to King Kong, I loved anything ape related, but at the time it was King Kong that was most obsessed with. \n\nSo, one day I decided to pick up my iPod Touch and search on the app store for a King Kong game, and I found one that was called something like King Kong Adventure. \n\nDue to a couple of factors I'll get into later, the game really stuck with me, even though I only played it a few times and barely progressed past the first few levels. \n\nEver since then the game periodically pops back intoy head, and every once in a while I get possessed by the urge to try and find the game, albeit to little avail, as it seems to have vanished from the internet entirely. \n\nI have searched for it on the Google Play Store, but it's not on there - it should be noted that I have not owned an Apple product since having that iPod Touch, and so it might have only ever been available on the IOS App Store, which I cannot access. \n\nThere is also no videos of it on YouTube, and when I search it on Google it brings up no relevant results. \n\nI know that the game definitely existed, because I have a twin brother and he also remembers it. \n\nBut, as I say, there is absolutely no mention or evidence of its existence anywhere on the internet - at least that I have been able to find. \n\nDoes anyone else remember this game? \n\nSurely there's other people out there who have played it? \n\nHere's what I remember of the game: \n\n• the title was something like King Kong Adventure, or Kong Island Adventure, or something along those lines. \n• it was a 2D platformer with Super Mario mechanics, i.e: navigating platforms and chasms from left to right, walking is manually operated, you play as an upright standing gorilla and jump on enemies and collect bananas, etc, etc. \n• the graphical style was very retro, being most similar to the Where The Wild Things Are game for the Nintendo DS. \n• there were two distinct game modes, both were exactly the same game but in different settings, one was a green, tropical forest, the other was a white, wintered forest. \n• by the far the most memorable thing was the music, and that is actually the main reason the game has persisted in my memory, and why I so desparately want to find it; the game had this really eerie, atmospheric music, with that typical 8-bit MIDI sound, but had a melody that was very creepy and harrowing, in a very atmospheric and vibey way. The only thing I've ever heard that sounds at all similar is the Atlantis Island music from Dragon City, circa 2014, which has a similar melody at points, but us otherwise not that similar. https://youtu.be/SzxJOFUd6tE?feature=shared skip to 0:20 to hear what I'm refernecing. \n\nIf anyone else has any memory or knowledge of this game, I would love to hear what you have to say. \n\nThanks.

    "text_content": "Chapter 1  \n  \n  I FOUND HIM in Ponta Pora, a pleasant little town in Brazil, on the border of Paraguay, in a land still known as the Frontier.  \n  \n  They found him living in a shaded brick house on Rua Tiradentes, a wide avenue with trees down the center and barefoot boys dribbling soccer balls along the hot pavement.  \n  \n  They found him alone, as best they could tell, though a maid came and went at odd hours during the eight days they hid and watched.  \n  \n  They found him living a comfortable life but certainly not one of luxury. The house was modest and could've been owned by any local merchant. The car was a 1983 Volkswagen Beetle, manufactured in Sao Paulo with a million others. It was red and clean, polished to a shine. Their first photo of him was snapped as he waxed it just inside the gate to his short driveway.  \n  \n  They found him much thinner, down considerably from the two hundred and thirty pounds he'd been carrying when last seen. His hair and skin were darker, his chin had been squared, and his nose had been slightly pointed. Subtle changes to the face. They'd paid a steep bribe to the surgeon in Rio who'd performed the alterations two and a half years earlier.  \n  \n  They found him after four years of tedious but diligent searching, four years of dead ends and lost trails and false tips, four years of pouring good money down the drain, good money chasing bad, it seemed.  \n  \n  But they found him. And they waited. There was at first the desire to snatch him immediately, to drug him and smuggle him to a safe house in Paraguay, to seize him before he saw them or before a neighbor became suspicious. The initial excitement of the finding made them consider a quick strike, but after two days they settled down and waited. They loitered at various points along Rua Tiradentes, dressed like the locals, drinking tea in the shade, avoiding the sun, eating ice cream, talking to the children, watching his house. They tracked him as he drove downtown to shop, and they photographed him from across the street as he left the pharmacy. They eased very near him in a fruit market and listened as he spoke to the clerk. Excellent Portuguese, with the very slight accent of an American or a German who'd studied hard. He moved quickly downtown, gathering his goods and returning home, where he locked the gate behind him. His brief shopping trip yielded a dozen fine photos.  \n  \n  He had jogged in a prior life, though in the months before he disappeared his mileage shrunk as his weight ballooned. Now that he teetered on the brink of emaciation, they were not surprised to see him running again. He left his house, locking the gate behind him, and began a slow trot down the sidewalk along Rua Tiradentes. Nine minutes for the first mile, as the street went perfectly straight and the houses grew farther apart. The pavement turned to gravel on the edge of town, and halfway into the second mile his pace was down to eight minutes a mile and Danilo had himself a nice sweat. It was midday in October, the temperature near eighty, and he gained speed as he left town, past a small clinic packed with young mothers, past a small church the Baptists had built. The roads became dustier as he headed for the countryside at seven minutes a mile.  \n  \n  The running was serious business, and it pleased them mightily. Danilo would simply run into their arms.  \n  \n  THE DAY after the first sighting, a small unclean cottage on the edge of Ponta Pora was rented by a Brazilian named Osmar, and before long the rest of the pursuit team poured in. It was an equal mix of Americans and Brazilians, with Osmar giving the orders in Portuguese and Guy barking in English. Osmar could handle both languages, and had become the official interpreter for the team.  \n  \n  Guy was from Washington, an ex-government type who'd been hired to find Danny Boy, as he'd been nicknamed. Guy was considered a genius at some levels and immensely talented at others, and his past was a black hole. He was well into his fifth one-year contract to find Danny Boy, and there was a nice bonus for snagging the prey. Though he hid it well, Guy had been slowly cracking under the pressure of not finding Danny Boy.  \n  \n  Four years and three and a half million dollars, with nothing to show for it.  \n  \n  But now they'd found him.  \n  \n  Osmar and his band of Brazilians had not the slightest hint of Danny Boy's sins, but a fool could see that he'd disappeared and taken a trainload of money. And, although he was very curious about Danny Boy, Osmar had learned quickly not to ask questions. Guy and the Americans had nothing to say on the subject.  \n  \n  The pictures of Danny Boy were enlarged to eight by tens, and tacked along a wall in the kitchen of the dirty little cottage where they were studied by grim men with hard eyes, men who chain-smoked strong cigarettes and shook their heads at the photos. They whispered among themselves and compared the new photos to the old ones, the ones from his previous life. Smaller man, odd chin, different nose. His hair was shorter and his skin darker. Was it really him?  \n  \n  They had been through this before, in Recife, on the northeastern coast, nineteen months earlier when they'd rented an apartment and looked at photos on the wall until the decision was made to grab the American and check his fingerprints. Wrong prints. Wrong American. They pumped some more drugs in him and left him in a ditch.  \n  \n  They were afraid to dig too deeply into the current life of Danilo Silva. If he was in fact their man, then he had plenty of money. And cash always worked wonders with the local authorities. For decades, cash had bought protection for Nazis and other Germans who'd smuggled themselves into Ponta Pora.  \n  \n  Osmar wanted to grab him. Guy said they'd wait. He vanished on the fourth day, and the dirty little cottage was in chaos for thirty-six hours.  \n  \n  They saw him leave home in the red Beetle. He was in a hurry, came the report. He raced across town to the airport, jumped on a small commuter at the last moment, and was gone. His car was parked in the only lot, and they watched it every second of every hour. The plane was headed in the general direction of Sao Paulo, with four stops in between.  \n  \n  There was instantly a plan to enter his home and catalog everything. There had to be records. The money had to be tended to. Guy dreamed of finding bank statements, wire transfer reports, account summaries; all sorts of documents arranged in a neat portfolio which would lead him directly to the money.  \n  \n  But he knew better. If Danny Boy ran because of them, then he would never leave behind the evidence. And if he was in fact their man, then his home would be carefully secured. Danny Boy, wherever he was, would probably know the instant they opened his door or window.  \n  \n  They waited. They cursed and argued and strained even more under the pressure. Guy made his daily call to Washington, a nasty one. They watched the red Beetle. Each arrival brought out the binoculars and cell phones. Six flights the first day. Five the second. The dirty little cottage grew hot and the men settled outdoors-the Americans napping under a scrawny shade tree in the backyard and the Brazilians playing cards along the fence in the front.  \n  \n  Guy and Osmar took a long drive and vowed to grab him if he ever returned. Osmar was confident he would be back. Probably just out of town on business, whatever his business was. They'd snatch him, identify him, and if he happened to be the wrong man they'd simply throw him in a ditch and run. It had happened before.  \n  \n  He returned on the fifth day. They trailed him back to Rua Tiradentes, and everybody was happy.  \n  \n  ON THE EIGHTH DAY, the dirty cottage emptied as all the Brazilians and all the Americans took their positions.  \n  \n  The course was a six-miler. He had covered it each day he'd been home, leaving at almost the same time, wearing the same blue and orange runner's shorts, well-worn Nikes, ankle socks, no shirt.  \n  \n  The perfect spot was two and a half miles from his house, over a small hill on a gravel road, not far from his turning-around point. Danilo topped the hill twenty minutes into his run, a few seconds ahead of schedule. He ran harder, for some reason. Probably the clouds.  \n  \n  A small car  \nwith a flat tire was just over the hill, blocking the road, trunk opened, its rear jacked up. Its driver was a burly young man who pretended to be startled at the sight of the skinny racer sweating and panting as he topped the hill. Danilo slowed for a second. There was more room to the right.  \n  \n  \"Bom dia,\" the burly young man said as he took a step toward Danilo.  \n  \n  \"Bom dia,\" Danilo said, approaching the car.  \n  \n  The driver suddenly pulled a large shiny pistol from the trunk and shoved it into Danilo's face. He froze, his eyes locked onto the gun, his mouth open with heavy breathing. The driver had thick hands and long, stout arms. He grabbed Danilo by the neck and yanked him roughly toward the car, then down to the bumper. He stuck the pistol in a pocket and with both hands folded Danilo into the trunk. Danny Boy struggled and kicked, but was no match.  \n  \n  The driver slammed the trunk shut, lowered the car, tossed the jack into the ditch, and drove off. A mile away, he turned onto a narrow dirt path where his pals were anxiously waiting.  \n  \n  They tied nylon ropes around Danny Boy's wrists and a black cloth over his eyes, then shoved him into the back of a van. Osmar sat to his right, another Brazilian to his left. Someone removed his keys from the Velcro runner's pouch stuck to his waist. Danilo said nothing as the van started and began moving. He was still sweating and breathing even harder.  \n  \n  When the van stopped on a dusty road near a farm field, Danilo uttered his first words. \"What do you want?\" he asked, in Portuguese.  \n  \n  \"Don't speak,\" came the reply from Osmar, in English. The Brazilian to Danilo's left removed a syringe from a small metal box and deftly filled it with a potent liquid. Osmar pulled Danilo's wrists tightly toward him while the other man jabbed the needle into his upper arm. He stiffened and jerked, then realized it was hopeless. He actually relaxed as the last of the drug entered his body. His breathing slowed; his head began to wobble. When his chin hit his chest, Osmar gently, with his right index finger, raised the shorts on Danilo's right leg, and found exactly what he expected to find. Pale skin.  \n  \n  The running kept him thin, and it also kept him brown.  \n  \n  Kidnappings were all too common in the Frontier. Americans were easy targets. But why him? Danilo asked himself this as his head wobbled and his eyes closed. He smiled as he fell through space, dodging comets and meteors, grabbing at moons and grinning through entire galaxies.  \n  \n  THEY STUFFED HIM under some cardboard boxes filled with melons and berries. The border guards nodded without leaving their chairs, and Danny Boy was now in Paraguay, though he couldn't have cared less at the moment. He bounced happily along on the floor of the van as the roads grew worse and the terrain steeper. Osmar chain-smoked and occasionally pointed this way and that. An hour after they grabbed him, they found the last turn. The cabin was in a crevice between two pointed hills, barely visible from the narrow dirt road. They carried him like a sack of meal and poured him onto a table in the den where Guy and the fingerprint man went to work.  \n  \n  Danny Boy snored heavily as prints were made of all eight fingers and both thumbs. The Americans and the Brazilians crowded around, watching every move. There was unopened whiskey in a box by the door, just in case this was the real Danny Boy.  \n  \n  The print man left abruptly and went to a room in the back where he locked the door and spread the fresh prints before him. He adjusted his lighting. He removed the master set, those freely given by Danny Boy when he was much younger, back when he was Patrick and seeking admission to the State Bar of Louisiana. Odd, this fingerprinting of lawyers.  \n  \n  Both sets were in fine shape, and it was immediately obvious they were a perfect match. But he meticulously checked all ten. There was no hurry. Let them wait out there. He rather enjoyed the moment. He finally opened the door and frowned hard at the dozen faces searching his. Then he smiled. \"It's him,\" he said, in English, and they actually clapped.  \n  \n  Guy approved the whiskey, but only in moderation. There was more work to do. Danny Boy, still comatose, was given another shot and carried to a small bedroom with no window and a heavy door which locked from the outside. It was here that he would be interrogated, and tortured, if necessary.  \n  \n  THE BAREFOOT BOYS playing soccer in the street were too involved in their game to look up. Danny Boy's key ring had only four keys on it, and so the small front gate was unlocked quickly, and left open. An accomplice in a rented car came to a stop near a large tree four houses down. Another, on a motorbike, parked himself at the other end of the street and began tinkering with his brakes.  \n  \n  If a security system started howling upon entry, the intruder would simply run and never be seen again. If not, then he would lock himself in and take inventory.  \n  \n  The door opened without sirens. The security panel on the wall informed whoever might be looking that the system was disarmed. He breathed lightly and stood perfectly still for a full minute, then began to move around. He removed the hard drive from Danny Boy's PC, and collected all the disks. He rummaged through files on his desk, but found nothing but routine bills, some paid, others waiting. The fax was cheap and featureless, and declared itself to be out of order. He took photos of clothing, food, furniture, bookshelves, magazine racks.  \n  \n  Five minutes after the door opened, a silent signal was activated in Danilo's attic and a phone call was placed to a private security firm eleven blocks away, in downtown Ponta Pora. The call went unanswered because the security consultant on duty was swaying gently in a hammock out back. A recorded message from Danilo's house informed whoever was supposed to be listening that there was a break-in. Fifteen minutes passed before human ears heard the message. By the time the consultant raced to Danilo's house, the intruder was gone. So was Mr. Silva. Everything appeared to be in order, including the Beetle under the carport. The house and gate were locked.  \n  \n  The directions in the file were specific. On such alarms, do not call the police. Try first to locate Mr. Silva, and in the event he cannot be found at once, then call a number in Rio. Ask for Eva Miranda. -  \n  \n  WITH BARELY suppressed excitement, Guy made his daily call to Washington. He actually closed his eyes and smiled when he uttered the words, \"It's him. \" His voice was an octave higher.  \n  \n  There was a pause on the other end. Then, \"You're certain?\"  \n  \n  \"Yes. Prints are a perfect match. \"  \n  \n  Another pause while Stephano arranged his thoughts, a process that usually took milliseconds. \"The money?\"  \n  \n  \"We haven't started yet. He's still drugged. \"  \n  \n  \"When?\"  \n  \n  \"Tonight. \"  \n  \n  \"I'm by the phone. \" Stephano hung up, though he could've talked for hours.  \n  \n  Guy found a perch on a stump behind the cabin. The vegetation was dense, the air thin and cool. The soft voices of happy men drifted up to him. The ordeal was over, for the most part.  \n  \n  He had just earned an extra fifty thousand dollars. Finding the money would mean another bonus, and he was certain he'd find the money.\n\nChapter 2  \n  \n  DOWNTOWN RIO. In a small neat office on the tenth floor of a high-rise, Eva Miranda squeezed the phone with both hands and slowly repeated the words she had just heard. The silent alarm had summoned the security guard. Mr. Silva wasn't at home, but his car was parked in the drive and the house was locked.  \n  \n  Someone had entered, tripped the alarm, and it couldn't be a false one because it was still activated when the security guard arrived.  \n  \n  Danilo was missing.  \n  \n  Maybe he'd gone jogging and neglected the routine. According to the guard's account, the silent alarm had been activated an hour and ten minutes ago. But Danilo jogged for less than an hour-six miles at seven to eight minutes per, total of fifty minutes max. No exceptions. She knew his movements. •She called his home on Rua Tiradentes, and no one answered. She called the number to a cell phone he sometimes kept nearby, and no one answered.  \n  \n  He had accidentally tripped the alarm three months ago, and scared them both badly. But a quick phone call from her had cleared up the matter.  \n  \n  He was much too careful about the security system to get careless. It meant too much.  \n  \n  She made the calls again, with the same results. There is an explanation for this, she told herself.  \n  \n  She dialed the number to an apartment in Curitiba, a city of a million and a half, and the capital of the state of Parana. To their knowledge, no one knew of the apartment. It was leased under another name and used for storage and infrequent meetings. They spent short weekends there occasionally; not often enough to suit Eva.  \n  \n  She expected no answer at the apartment and got none. Danilo would not go there without first calling her.  \n  \n  When the phone calls were finished, she locked her office door and leaned against it with her eyes closed. Associates and secretaries could be heard in the hallway. The firm had thirty-three lawyers at the moment, second largest in Rio with a branch in Sao Paulo and another in New York. Telephones and faxes and copiers blended together in a busy distant chorus.  \n  \n  At thirty-one, she was a seasoned five-year associate with the firm; seasoned to the point of working the long hours and coming in on Saturdays. Fourteen partners ran the firm, but only two were women. She had plans to change that ratio. Ten of the nineteen associates were female, evidence that in Brazil, as in the United States, women were rapidly entering the profession. She studied law at the Catholic University in Rio, one of the finer schools, in her opinion. Her father still taught philosophy there.  \n  \n  He had insisted she study law at Georgetown after studying law in Rio. Georgetown was his alma mater. His influence, along with her impressive resume, striking looks, and fluent English made finding a top job with a top firm a quick chore.  \n  \n  She paused at her window and told herself to relax. Time was suddenly crucial. The next series of moves required steady nerves. Then she would have to disappear. There was a meeting in thirty minutes, but it would have to be postponed.  \n  \n  The file was locked in a small fireproof drawer. She removed it and read again the sheet of instructions; directions she and Danilo had covered many times.  \n  \n  He knew they would find him.  \n  \n  Eva had preferred to ignore the possibility.  \n  \n  Her mind drifted as she worried about his safety. The phone rang and startled her. It was not Danilo. A client was waiting, her secretary said. The client was early. Apologize to the client, she instructed, and politely reschedule the appointment. Do not disturb again.  \n  \n  The money was currently parked in two places: a bank in Panama, and an offshore holding trust in Bermuda. Her first fax authorized the immediate wire transfer of the money out of Panama and into a bank in Antigua. Her second fax scattered it among three banks on Grand Cayman. The third yanked it out of Bermuda and parked it in the Bahamas.  \n  \n  It was almost two in Rio. The European banks were closed, so she would be forced to skip the money around the Caribbean for a few hours until the rest of the world opened.  \n  \n  Danilo's instructions were clear but general. The details were left to her discretion. The initial wires were determined by Eva. She decided which banks got how much money. She had made the list of the fictitious corporate names under which the money was hidden; a list Danilo had never seen. She divided, dispersed, routed, and rerouted. It was a drill they had rehearsed many times, but without the specifics.  \n  \n  Danilo couldn't know where the money went. Only Eva. She had the unbridled discretion, at this moment and under these extreme circumstances, to move it as she saw fit. Her specialty was trade law. Most of her clients were Brazilian businessmen who wanted to develop exports to the United States and Canada. She understood foreign markets, currencies, banking. What she hadn't known about zipping money around the world, Danilo had taught her.  \n  \n  She glanced repeatedly at her watch. More than an hour had passed since the phone call from Ponta Pora.  \n  \n  As another fax rolled through the machine, the phone rang again. Certainly it was Danilo, finally, with a wild story and all of this was for nothing. Perhaps just a dry run, a rehearsal to test her mettle under pressure. But he was not one to play games.  \n  \n  It was a partner, quite perturbed that she was late for yet another meeting. She apologized with short words and returned to her fax.  \n  \n  The pressure mounted with each passing minute. Still no'word from Danilo. No answers to her repeated calls. If they had in fact found him, then they wouldn't wait long before they tried to make him talk.  \n  \n  That was what he feared the most. That was why she had to run.  \n  \n  An hour and a half. Reality was settling hard on her shoulders. Danilo was missing, and he would never disappear without first telling her. He planned his movements too carefully, always fearful of the shadows behind him. Their worst nightmare was unfolding, and quickly.  \n  \n  At a pay phone in the lobby of her office building, Eva made two calls. The first was to her apartment manager, to see if anyone had been to her apartment in Leblon, in Rio's South Zone, where the wealthy lived and the beautiful played. The answer was no, but the manager promised to watch things. The second call was to the office of the FBI in Biloxi, Mississippi. It was an emergency, she explained as calmly as possible with her best effort at accentless American English. She waited, knowing that from this moment forward there was no turning back.  \n  \n  Someone had taken Danilo. His past had finally caught him.  \n  \n  \"Hello,\" came the voice, as if it were only a block away.  \n  \n  \"Agent Joshua Cutter?\"  \n  \n  \"Yes. \"  \n  \n  She. paused slightly. \"Are you in charge of the Patrick Lanigan investigation?\" She knew perfectly well that he was.  \n  \n  A pause on his end. \"Yes. Who is this?\"  \n  \n  They would trace the call to Rio, and that would take about three minutes. Then their tracking would drown in a city of ten million. But she looked around nervously anyway.  \n  \n  \"I'm calling from Brazil,\" she said, according to script. \"They've captured Patrick. \"  \n  \n  \"Who?\" Cutter asked.  \n  \n  \"I'll give you a name. \"  \n  \n  \"I'm listening,\" Cutter said, his voice suddenly edgy.  \n  \n  \"Jack Stephano. Do you know him?\"  \n  \n  A pause as Cutter tried to place the name. \"No. Who is he?\"  \n  \n  \"A private agent in Washington. He's been searching for Patrick for the past four years. \"  \n  \n  \"And you say he's found him, right?\"  \n  \n  \"Yes. His men found him. \"  \n  \n  \"Where?\"  \n  \n  \"Here. In Brazil. \"  \n  \n  \"When?\"  \n  \n  \"Today. And I think they might kill him. \"  \n  \n  Cutter pondered this for a second, then asked, \"What else can you tell me?\"  \n  \n  She gave him Stephano's phone number in D. C. , then hung up and wandered out of the building.  \n  \n  GUY CAREFULLY FLIPPED through the assorted papers taken from Danny Boy's house, and marveled at the invisible trail. A monthly statement from a local bank listed a balance of three thousand dollars, not exactly what they had in mind. The only deposit was for eighteen hundred, debits for t  \nhe month of less than a thousand. Danny Boy lived quite frugally. His electric and phone bills were unpaid but not past due. A dozen other small bills were marked paid.  \n  \n  One of Guy's men checked all the phone numbers on Danny Boy's bill, but turned up nothing interesting. Another scoured the hard drive from his little computer and quickly learned that Danny Boy was not much of a hacker. There was a lengthy journal about his adventures in the Brazilian outback. The last entry was almost a year old.  \n  \n  The scarcity of paperwork was in itself very suspicious. Only one bank statement? Who on the face of the earth keeps only last month's bank statement in the house? What about the month before? Danny Boy had a storage place somewhere, away from his home. It all fit nicely with a man on the run.  \n  \n  At dusk, Danny Boy, still unconscious, was stripped to his underwear, tight cotton briefs. His dirty running shoes and sweaty running socks were pulled off, revealing feet that nearly glowed in their whiteness. His new dark skin was counterfeit. He was placed on a one-inch-thick sheet of plywood next to his bed. Holes had been cut in the board and nylon ropes were used to tightly secure his ankles, knees, waist, chest, and wrists. A wide black plastic belt was strapped tightly across his forehead. An IV drip bag hung directly above his face. The tube ran to a vein above his left wrist.  \n  \n  He was poked with another needle; a shot in his left arm to wake him up. His labored breathing grew more rapid, and when his eyes opened they were red and glazed and took a while to study the drip bag. The Brazilian doctor stepped into the picture, and without saying a word stuck a needle into Danny Boy's left arm. It was sodium thiopental, a- crude drug sometimes used to make people talk. Truth serum. It worked best if the captive had things he wanted to confess. A perfect tell-all drug had yet to be developed.  \n  \n  Ten minutes passed. He tried to move his head, without success. He could see a few feet on either side. The room was dark except for a small light somewhere in a corner behind him.  \n  \n  The door opened, then closed. Guy entered alone. He walked straight to Danny Boy, placed his fingers on the edge of the plywood, and said, \"Hello, Patrick. \"  \n  \n  Patrick closed his eyes. Danilo Silva was behind him now, gone forever. An old trusted friend vanished, just like that. The simple life on Rua Tiradentes faded away with Danilo; his precious anonymity ripped away from him with the pleasant words, \"Hello, Patrick. \"  \n  \n  For four years, he had often wondered how it would feel if they caught him. Would there be a sense of relief? Of justice? Any excitement at the prospect of going home to face the music?  \n  \n  Absolutely not! At the moment, Patrick was terror-stricken. Practically naked and strapped down like an animal, he knew the next few hours would be insufferable.  \n  \n  \"Can you hear me, Patrick?\" Guy asked, peering downward, and Patrick smiled, not because he wanted to but because an urge he couldn't control found something amusing.  \n  \n  The drug was taking effect, Guy noted. Sodium thiopental is a short-acting barbiturate that must be administered in very controlled doses. It was extremely difficult to find the proper level of consciousness where one would be susceptible to interrogation.  \n  \n  Too small a dose, and the resistance is not broken. A bit too much, and the subject is simply knocked out.  \n  \n  The door opened and closed. Another American slipped into the room to listen, but Patrick could not see him.  \n  \n  \"You've been sleeping for three days, Patrick,\" Guy said. It was closer to five hours, but how could Patrick know? \"Are you hungry or thirsty?\"  \n  \n  \"Thirsty,\" Patrick said.  \n  \n  Guy unscrewed the top from a small bottle of mineral water, and carefully poured it between Patrick's lips.  \n  \n  \"Thanks,\" he said, then smiled.  \n  \n  \"Are you hungry?\" Guy asked again.  \n  \n  \"No. What do you want?\"  \n  \n  Guy slowly sat the mineral water on a table and leaned closer to Patrick's face. \"Let's settle something first, Patrick. While you were sleeping, we took your fingerprints. We know precisely who you are, so can we please forgo the initial denials?\"  \n  \n  \"Who am I?\" Patrick asked with another grin.  \n  \n  \"Patrick Lanigan. \"  \n  \n  \"From where?\"  \n  \n  \"Biloxi, Mississippi. Born in New Orleans. Law school at Tulane. Wife, one daughter, age six. Missing now for over four years. \"  \n  \n  \"Bingo. That's me. \"  \n  \n  \"Tell me, Patrick, did you watch your own burial service?\"  \n  \n  \"Is that a crime?\"  \n  \n  \"No. Just a rumor. \"  \n  \n  \"Yes. I watched it. I was touched by it. Didn't know I had so many friends. \"  \n  \n  \"How nice. Where did you hide after your burial?\"  \n  \n  \"Here and there. \"  \n  \n  A shadow emerged from the left and a hand adjusted the valve at the bottom of the drip bag. \"What's that?\" Patrick asked.  \n  \n  \"A cocktail,\" Guy answered, nodding at the other man, who retreated to the corner.  \n  \n  \"Where's the money, Patrick?\" Guy asked with a smile.  \n  \n  \"What money?\"  \n  \n  \"The money you took with you. \"  \n  \n  \"Oh, that money,\" Patrick said, and breathed deeply. His eyelids closed suddenly and his body relaxed. Seconds passed and his chest moved slower, up and down.  \n  \n  \"Patrick,\" Guy said, gently shaking his arm. No response, just the sounds of a deep sleep.  \n  \n  The dosage was immediately reduced, and they waited.  \n  \n  THE FBI FILE on Jack Stephano was a quick study; former Chicago detective with two degrees in criminology, former high-priced bounty hunter, expert marksman, self-taught master of search and espionage, and now the owner of a shady D. C. firm which apparently charged huge fees to locate missing people and conduct expensive surveillance.  \n  \n  The FBI file on Patrick Lanigan filled eight boxes. It made sense that one file would attract the other. There was no shortage of people who wanted Patrick found and brought home. Stephano's group had been hired to do it.  \n  \n  Stephano's firm, Edmund Associates, occupied the top floor of a nondescript building on K Street, six blocks from the White House. Two agents waited in the lobby by the elevator as two others stormed Stephano's office. They almost scuffled with a heavy secretary who insisted Mr. Stephano was too busy at the moment. They found him at his desk, alone, chatting happily on the phone. His smile vanished when they barged in with badges flashing.  \n  \n  \"What the hell is this!\" Stephano demanded. The wall behind his desk was a richly detailed map of the world, complete with little red blinking lights stuck on green continents. Which one was Patrick?  \n  \n  \"Who hired you to find Patrick Lanigan?\" asked Agent One.  \n  \n  \"That's confidential,\" Stephano sneered. He'd been a cop for years and was not easy to intimidate.  \n  \n  \"We got a call from Brazil this afternoon,\" said Agent Two.  \n  \n  So did I, thought Stephano, stunned by this but desperately trying to appear unfazed. His jaw dropped an inch and his shoulders sagged as his mind raced wildly through all the possible theories that would bring these two thugs here. He'd talked to Guy and no one else. Guy was utterly dependable. Guy would never talk to anyone, especially the FBI. It couldn't be Guy.  \n  \n  Guy used a cell phone from the mountains of eastern Paraguay. There was no way the call could have been intercepted.  \n  \n  \"Are you there?\" asked Two smartly.  \n  \n  \"Yeah,\" he said, hearing but not hearing.  \n  \n  \"Where's Patrick?\" asked One.  \n  \n  \"Maybe he's in Brazil. \"  \n  \n  \"Where in Brazil?\"  \n  \n  Stephano managed a shrug, a stiff one. \"I dunno. It's a big country. \"  \n  \n  \"We have an outstanding warrant for him,\" One said. \"He belongs to us. \"  \n  \n  Stephano shrugged again, this time a more casual one as if to say, \"Big deal. \"  \n  \n  \"We want him,\" demanded Two. \"And now. \" , \"I can't help you. \"  \n  \n  \"You're lying,\" snarled One, and with that both of them joined together in front of Stephano's desk and glared down. Agent Two did the talking. \"We have men downstairs, outside, around the corner, and outside your home in Falls Church. We'll watch every move  \nyou make from now until we get Lanigan. \"  \n  \n  \"Fine. You can leave now. \"  \n  \n  \"And don't hurt him, okay? We'll be happy to nail your ass if anything happens to our boy. \"  \n  \n  They left in step and Stephano locked the door behind them. His office had no windows. He stood before his map of the world. Brazil had three red lights, which meant little. His head shook slowly, in complete bewilderment.  \n  \n  He spent so much time and money covering his tracks.  \n  \n  His firm was known in certain circles as the best at taking the money and disappearing into the shadows. He'd never been caught before. No one ever knew who Stephano was stalking.  \n**Enjoyed it? Upvote and comment! Want the full story? Say so below and I’ll post it.**",

Bryan, of whom I inquired as to its arrival, is greatly alarmed lest it has been sent to the soldiers’ dinner. If the soldiers get it, I shall be content. I can do very well without it. In fact, I should rather they should have it than I....”\n\nThe soldiers’ “dinner” here referred to was a Christmas dinner, sent by the entire country, as far as they could, to the poor starving men in the trenches and camps along the lines. It would not be considered much now, but when the conditions were such as my father describes when he wrote the Secretary of War,\n\n“The struggle now is to keep the army fed and clothed. Only fifty men in some regiments have shoes, and bacon is only issued once in a few days,” anything besides the one-quarter of a pound of bacon and musty corn-bread was a treat of great service, and might be construed as “a Christmas dinner.”\n\nI have mentioned before my father’s devotion to children. This sentiment pervaded his whole nature. At any time the presence of a little child would bring a brightness to his smile, a tender softness to his glance, and drive away gloom or care. Here is his account of a visit paid him, early in January, 1865, by three little women:\n\n  \n\n\n“...Yesterday afternoon three little girls walked into my room, each with a small basket. The eldest carried some fresh eggs, laid by her own hens; the second, some pickles made by her mother; the third, some popcorn grown in her garden. They were accompanied by a young maid with a block of soap made by her mother. They were the daughters of a Mrs. Nottingham, a refugee from Northhampton County, who lived near Eastville, not far from ‘old Arlington.’ The eldest of the girls, whose age did not exceed eight years, had a small wheel on which she spun for her mother, who wove all the cloth for her two brothers—boys of twelve and fourteen years. I have not had so pleasant a visit for a long time. I fortunately was able to fill their baskets with apples, which distressed poor Bryan \\[his mess-steward\\], and I begged them to bring me nothing but kisses and to keep the eggs, corn, etc., for themselves. I pray daily and almost hourly to our Heavenly Father to come to the relief of you and our afflicted country. I know He will order all things for our good, and we must be content.”\n\n  \n\n\nLee writes:\n\n\n\n“...Deeply impressed with the difficulties and responsibilities of the position, and humbly invoking the guidance of Almighty God, I rely for success upon the courage and fortitude of the army, sustained by the patriotism and firmness of the people, confident that their united efforts under the blessing of Heaven will secure peace and independence....”\n\n\n\nGeneral Beauregard, who had so ably defended Petersburg when it was first attacked, and who had assisted so materially in its subsequent defense, had been sent to gather troops to try to check Sherman’s advance through the Carolinas. But Beauregard’s health was now very bad, and it was feared he would have to abandon the field.“...In the event of the necessity of abandoning our position on James River, I shall endeavor to unite the corps of the army about Burkeville \\[junction of Southside and Danville Railroad\\], so as to retain communication with the North and South as long as practicable, and also with the West, I should think Lynchburg, or some point west, the most advantageous place to which to remove stores from Richmond. This, however, is a most difficult point at this time to decide, and the place may have to be changed by circumstances. It was my intention in my former letter to apply for General Joseph E. Johnston, that I might assign him to duty, should circumstances permit. I have had no official report of the condition of General Beauregard’s health. It is stated from many sources to be bad. If he should break down entirely, it might be fatal. In that event, I should have no one with whom to supply his place. I therefore respectfully request General Johnston may be ordered to report to me, and that I may be informed where he is.” In a letter to the Secretary of War.  February 21, 1865.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Long says that General Meade called on General Lee on the 10th of April, and in the course of conversation remarked:\n\n“Now that the war may be considered over, I hope you will not deem it improper for me to ask, for my personal information, the strength of your army during the operations around Richmond and Petersburg.” General Lee replied:\n\n“At no time did my force exceed 35,000 men; often it was less.” With a look of surprise, Meade answered:\n\n“General, you amaze me; we always estimated your force at about seventy thousand men.”\n\nGeneral de Chanal, a French officer, who was present, states that General Lee, who had been an associate of Meade’s in the engineers in the “old army,” said to him pleasantly:\n\n“Meade, years are telling on you; your hair is getting quite gray.”\n\n“Ah, General Lee,” was Meade’s prompt reply, “it is not the work of years; YOU are responsible for my gray hairs!”\n\n“Three days after the surrender,” says Long, “the Army of Northern Virginia had dispersed in every direction, and three weeks later the veterans of a hundred battles had exchanged the musket and the sword for the implements of husbandry. It is worthy of remark that never before was there an army disbanded with less disorder. Thousands of soldiers were set adrift on the world without a penny in their pockets to enable them to reach their homes. Yet none of the scenes of riot that often follow the disbanding of armies marked their course.”",

While the original Cosmos models focused on generating synthetic video data, the new Cosmos Reason takes a different approach — it's designed to actually understand what's happening in physical spaces and plan accordingly.\n\nThe latest releases include Cosmos Transfer-2 for faster synthetic data generation and a distilled version optimized for speed. But Cosmos Reason is the standout, promising to help robots and AI agents think through spatial problems like predicting when \"a person stepping into a crosswalk or a box falling from a shelf\" might happen.\n\nThis represents Nvidia's continued push into what it calls \"physical AI\" where they are trying to bridge the gap between AI that works well with text and images, and AI that can actually navigate and manipulate the real world. Robotics companies have been struggling with the expensive process of collecting enough real-world training data to make their systems reliable.\n\nCompanies like[ 1X, Skild AI, and others](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.929jZiiRht9qZPYC5Z_-teSzLBSf_0iauhguQ-NLnIvbn3lBCR30smWoEbzKJZ-WyUka0SfMJUCdBRl5WDHKgIQ_8RUIae0FoTnp17H2yj8t-IhkKaFW9On1BYE7SeeQx8Z8Wyhm9Y2-ZQp-5ivDe1C29jjqHgAI5EVLIGYEUG_nxIFXJzXBMuRAPrd1QYfxXIvJdbQeI5BD3NOR2fm6vl3GrgPcmYXQ0Lc28foH4GAiG3_xCYlq9orP_mWs35ukxOLt-r0Q7Pi9lHGwH_-5JljTQLYhaAyTFsffIibfLQiXZHdOFCDmcxa_T4bRtMnp2ravS5aD61GtCir6fPM4RqrYixrYtYgb1ABBauVUnwntXzG707yf7hHi5GOCcWdUw3U4oFAUmshXoTneW_OAbw/4iz/mea5FqgBThC194ay-sz2kQ/h26/h001.pKF_MaUTUIc_iquCuNxyHdaBrQ4TqB_HhejcMf5KC-A) are already testing Cosmos models, suggesting there's real demand for tools that can generate physics-aware synthetic data rather than forcing developers to film thousands of hours of robot footage.\n\nThe models are available through Nvidia's API catalog and can be downloaded from [Hugging Face](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.qNCZjjYQy9oQCZ7BSSPG-M40R4VPY45QdAKjwG_YMQHS3Xv5oN3w2TS4s0t9oauGcDGluVqFz8NLHU_waPt3WeF34nIPBins1tUxhSqoAUdcLfvPSY-ADGWfkB_lNleBbkkUEOEwxEXy2ydBD8-QaX2nFU1__sQJbEGQrmIfClGS4qFlAPRbtkpW-jTnnPT7KkJgylYX44gf0ro8kKdd2jyQIDVtvHJzcJ9nk5Ppfi5r-zGVFpSpaNVZh5VhyNHj9lZTwEnjgQALt22TFpbvmw/4iz/mea5FqgBThC194ay-sz2kQ/h27/h001.jl77PyeGucVJ3sVZIIta5TxDtAERP7FUPwbJvv3mWUo), continuing the company's strategy of making advanced AI infrastructure accessible while positioning itself as the essential platform for the next wave of robotics development.\n\n\n\n# 🛑 China urges firms not to use Nvidia H20\n\n* Chinese authorities are discouraging local companies from using Nvidia’s H20 chips, demanding firms justify orders over domestic alternatives and raising questions about potential hardware security issues.\n* Officials in Beijing are worried the processors could have location-tracking and remote shutdown capabilities, a specific concern that Nvidia has strenuously denied in recent statements to the press.\n* The government's push also targets AMD's MI308 accelerators as part of a wider state-led effort to develop homegrown semiconductor capabilities and reduce reliance on Western technology.\n\n# 🧠 Meta’s AI predicts brain responses to videos,\n\nMeta’s FAIR team just [**introduced**](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.6k0_SAz8nrOuu_-LoNX1Ha_P2AeSK-zqDihiqefKUPJ1A4px-JhkIH570mvYMcg-YRD-Xu5Acf8UHA-q0a1YFtxZ-A2BdSnjzKUq1-AwyXFPMVoXoT4qcCvfk-VuHfFN65YqwM7uyRYDTHWLGa3Z1vbMhAOo4nXuh5CdXGQUYz0Qli-8juJxtcx3HNJypEz4YqWqm8K8lQZSi-lAMzo4FCM11saEDIYkt-b0_i8FB53kImvNuwqYYCm3mBoIR4_zLaybSk4rH6MOt3FGlD_w_g/4iz/P_mNAVcDQOi6qh17J_JFxA/h7/h001.zfmJ0WX81wvrtskol2bDozyv_tk2A9hYDufhhA1FUGk) TRIBE, a 1B parameter neural network that predicts how human brains respond to movies by analyzing video, audio, and text — achieving first place in the Algonauts 2025 brain modeling competition.\n\n**The details:**\n\n* TRIBE analyzes video, audio, and dialogue from movies, accurately predicting which of the viewer’s brain regions will activate without any brain scanning.\n* The AI correctly predicted over half brain activity patterns across 1,000 brain regions after training on subjects who watched 80 hours of TV and movies.\n* It works best in brain areas where sight, sound, and language merge, outperforming single-sense models by 30%.\n* Meta's system also showed particular accuracy in frontal brain regions that control attention, decision-making, and emotional responses to content.\n\n**What it means:** We’ve only uncovered the tip of the iceberg when it comes to understanding the brain and its processes, and TRIBE and other AI systems are ramping up that knowledge. But they are also providing new formulas for maximizing attention on a neural level, potentially making doomscrolling even more irresistible.\n\n# 🏅 OpenAI's reasoner snags gold at programming olympiad\n\nOpenAI [**announced**](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.6k0_SAz8nrOuu_-LoNX1HaSIRI5hsnO_wp34T44KIz6-H34vwfUtR_AF405dy_4Al_oY8J6TRUO4CXzt-TSJiCvDdnnSEduqakX3S9BakIzQ8v0xPrgVqrefepktFcSGUmrocB0Q-F2d_pEkaiIw34Qrtqsn3QTzjpYUt7nvXemsRKpwhfMl20wD1wke9CKJD9ARLd3nGmaEY_BuH0lz_uRC3-HC9ahkpHEnwKQXKawCXv-l9jQ8tcW5KlZSfd40pi5fwQO3bF-rhLadAKlPNA/4iz/P_mNAVcDQOi6qh17J_JFxA/h13/h001.-AJzKI8qwEy5s_UTYxyQIh97rdxTEu1aZHOQ0zQLPRo) that its reasoning model achieved a gold-level score at the 2025 International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI), placing 6th against humans and first among AI in the world’s top pre-college programming competition.\n\n**The details:**\n\n* The AI competed against top student programmers worldwide, solving coding problems with the same time and submission limits as human contestants.\n* OpenAI’s model was a general-purpose reasoner, without specific fine-tuning for programming and relying on just basic tools.\n* The system scored in the 98th percentile, a massive jump from a 49% score just a year ago.\n* The same model also won gold at the International Math Olympiad and AtCoder, showing strength across a range of complex problem-solving areas.\n\n**What it means:** The 2x leap in score shows how fast reasoning capabilities have truly moved over the past year. The days of humans ahead of AI in competitions are numbered, and these achievements will likely be the stepping stones towards future models that are capable of discovering new science, math, physics, and more.\n\n\n\n# 💊 Korean researchers’ AI designs cancer drugs\n\nResearchers at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science &amp; Technology (KAIST) [**developed**](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.dSnm3kaGd0BkNqLYPjeMfxihQCl5g2YxDMYMm0AMA8rBgrbnteAOhFux9Gv8LTEYYr-uLuSA9jFzxQM_KC-8ss1sZnZg0VPypcd5t9ehgDMpAfCuPxQ-Ssvb6fTsAaNndlWfXKELSreRYL31Ndqu3GEeVNdDOVVxl6jN9plMgOZNbMhupWQIexqmC1NHb2tm4WWzZaPlVATdLtWYcyliUnEs7PH5kFGGWC5p_DD6qtiI2FXDPIL-8sM-6o1RhvAeajEgWUwECAIcw0RBJIgYaFCcN_xb3CJLyzuVBtvOK_NEkGjt1ju1YZdT0aA-W8QgGzoNFShQeA3yVRZOSdHfLp5_YiX85TZyhOKQUjVMjzxFVSvqIWhsvsLANwFrJzZuT_kG19V2pn4NzK5T5urHWA/4iz/P_mNAVcDQOi6qh17J_JFxA/h21/h001.JzPqLV1q7NBgnfeanTu9QWb03MIRN63yleK8mEa4DoQ) BInD, a new diffusion model that designs optimal cancer drug candidates from scratch without any prior molecular data or training examples.\n\n**The details:**\n\n* The AI designs both the drug molecule and how it will attach to diseased proteins in one step, rather than creating and then testing in multiple iterations.\n* BInD created drugs that target only cancer-causing protein mutations while leaving healthy versions alone, showing precision medicine capabilities.\n* Unlike older AI systems that could only optimize for one criterion at a time, BInD ensures drugs are safe, stable, and possible to manufacture all at once.\n* The model also learns from its successes, reusing winning strategies with a recycling technique to design better drugs without starting from scratch.\n\n**Why it matters:** Drug discovery continues to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of AI acceleration. While the first AI-designed drugs are just starting to come to market, it feels like we’re only a few steps away from the floodgates opening on humanity-altering medicine advances designed by advanced AI models.\n\n\n\n# 🤖 xAI Makes Grok 4 Free Globally, Days After GPT-5 Launch\n\nElon Musk’s company xAI has made its AI model Grok 4 freely accessible to users around the world for a limited time—a tactical move closely following OpenAI’s GPT-5 release.

The culprit? Inconsistency. Even with DeepThink reasoning boosts, these systems are elite in some domains and embarrassingly brittle in others. Sundar Pichai’s AJI label is now the polite way to say “brilliant idiot.”\n\n**How this hits reality:** AJI isn’t a half-step to AGI—it’s a chasm. Closing it means more than shoving GPUs and data at the problem; it requires breakthroughs in reasoning, planning, and memory. For teams betting on near-term AGI, this is a [**cold shower**](https://aisecret.us/r/a94df255?m=75fe0f74-46b6-4618-9375-07821bf777c6): your “almost there” model may still hallucinate its way out of a paper bag.\n\n**Key takeaway:** AGI isn’t just “more AJI”—it’s a different beast. And right now, the beast is missing teeth.\n\n# Claude’s Memory Goes Selective—And That’s the Point\n\n**What’s happening:** Anthropic rolled out a “search-and-reference” memory for Claude, letting users pull past chats on demand. It works across devices, keeps projects siloed, and never builds a persistent user profile. Unlike OpenAI’s always-on memory, Claude won’t “remember” unless [**explicitly asked**](https://aisecret.us/r/c029a694?m=75fe0f74-46b6-4618-9375-07821bf777c6) — no silent data hoarding, no surprise callbacks.\n\n**How this hits reality:** For enterprise buyers and compliance teams, Claude’s opt-in recall is a feature, not a bug. It sidesteps privacy backlash, keeps audit trails clean, and reduces the risk of unintentional behavioral profiling. OpenAI’s default-on approach gives richer personalization but also a bigger [**regulatory attack surface**](https://aisecret.us/r/354b005a?m=75fe0f74-46b6-4618-9375-07821bf777c6). In a market already twitchy about AI “overfamiliarity,” Anthropic just handed security teams an easy win.\n\n**Key takeaway:** Claude remembers only when told — turning “forgetfulness” into a trust moat OpenAI can’t claim.\n\n# Grok 4’s Chess Loss Is a PR Bloodbath for Musk\n\nPhoto by: kaggle\n\n**What’s happening:** While Elon Musk was busy telling Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella on GPT-5 launch day that OpenAI would “[**eat Microsoft alive**](https://aisecret.us/r/f75925be?m=75fe0f74-46b6-4618-9375-07821bf777c6),” his own LLM, Grok 4, was being eaten alive — 4–0 — by OpenAI’s o3 in a live-streamed Google Kaggle AI chess showdown. The kicker? Five-time world champion Magnus Carlsen was live on mic, laughing, face-palming, and likening Grok’s blunders to “kids’ games” and club amateurs who only know openings.\n\n**How this hits reality:** Forget Kaggle rankings — this was a [**marketing assassination**](https://aisecret.us/r/992e86e5?m=75fe0f74-46b6-4618-9375-07821bf777c6). In an arena meant to showcase AI prowess, Grok’s collapse gave OpenAI a free highlight reel of dominance, complete with the world’s best chess player laughing at Musk’s flagship model. In a hype war where perception is product, Grok 4 just took a branding loss it can’t spin.\n\n**Key takeaway:** In AI chess, as in AI marketing, one bad night can hand your rival a year’s worth of victory ads.\n\n# What Else Happened in AI on August 12th 2025?\n\n**Chinese AI lab Z AI** [**released**](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.siHJl2oxYc5G1hfeCOvt3e9nIxabv3onLCOtgHJhDn4VrrYCgsXHJhAu9Bi1jYiXiHPqHYYiLLGhNJRTtgDZsSITL8zkGgJiWgBDr0Sr0TY49OII2LAF_Zboc86h9XYYmPzNZa8IJD6i_y60MEf9oWkiQWFtgEkGLHdKNBemGLWD0HhSgTkYdrRExuNF4CSt3gcJLxoS8InQ6mn8WuFNKcRfc7FtP9x8nJUS-eF7Uef6ZaZnetpd1a8GCXM2T_Vg/4iz/P_mNAVcDQOi6qh17J_JFxA/h28/h001.zVEO2jGLSYBlrArTgzDV8zHgLqKyOMSBFpkli6F0kC0) GLM-4.5V, a new open-source visual reasoning model that achieves top scores on over 40 different benchmarks.\n\n**GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke** [**announced**](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.6k0_SAz8nrOuu_-LoNX1HcwduSS0zPmX09KBZjjx3ZzBs4ymFGHXnKZaF1I3Nc727WjjeKDIEwHbwO8nO7UYSykouFgnso8qM07Wer51doPYFGz5cECYNtbTJqDeN-IkfcaWrHp8hTs1nuzHrdi0h6b82CAGr3vtXOyf-8KGc94gVdc7LWxoIWztNJVP5be6Dz00cPOuxcdcKRpggx4LsXtjXMkR2zAD_n79D90awZvsmqCbagyN4xMjc4mLBIchsV1h4W5oF_ez2JxObfFOJg/4iz/P_mNAVcDQOi6qh17J_JFxA/h29/h001.5jKcUTayRfPUMN_USOia7l5IhFDXH9Gao-edtU5D57c) that he is leaving the company to pursue his own startup, with GitHub now being woven into Microsoft’s CoreAI department.\n\n**The U.S. government** is reportedly [**set to enter**](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.dSnm3kaGd0BkNqLYPjeMfz3sRxipJonf99jMXlaKZFcHW4edPZxPRbycqkJl01kXThJXy1nVKoSknz1WL23movlxNbZodBw9R0oCfp40AS4qxPjIfFgU36vfZeTUQzgSOaFBHF_EpUBa0KzsZ1ym66rpbaMZoajgCBc_EpeZ33G9mMYSvpzdq9BST87mTTmjEDaQZKpfuTsOEqtMpdhfEXqaCiYlN6GE78krBlV1adAEQ4cS8L3IJbUIBKDkeSWNsQriP3w32wpux6potMN9bUaKfE-DVynjUDtxNgtxgcie9vVY4Du6IeKwm0xqwwn_/4iz/P_mNAVcDQOi6qh17J_JFxA/h30/h001.2fTm1KUfe0ZTo14iZNf8ZOGdPuUXbCGPf7IIn81bXow) into a new agreement with chipmakers Nvidia and AMD that would provide a 15% cut of chip sales to China.\n\n**Pika Labs** [**introduced**](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.6k0_SAz8nrOuu_-LoNX1Heh_niAXJ2AISUQPGpp8W5eblJeN_OfiIlJbwMfiAxwcGy1gf59bcbctPaRifKY0IxAbiLUDmYzlfhzbEvVlR9IVeWOwrH2qX6iZnyYwa1neQ2af1gW1G71vN-2La9y4NtjD9CX5ZfuJHnCw2lY6PC_0wEjMqOK983Ws7uDcmedvN9hNWa1cM899PmW4syhnRTEnZdlVe-rki65Yj9Y0MQzIw_NxWQYf0lR9VfcTgz1XjBBaPg6j8eqyu9xUNI20gg/4iz/P_mNAVcDQOi6qh17J_JFxA/h31/h001.L7a386uqRUi0BUbmiblRxBgKR0LhP5taf703QRch_D0) a new video model rolling out to its social app, with the ability to generate HD-quality outputs with lip-sync and audio in six seconds or less.\n\n**Alibaba** [**announced**](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.6k0_SAz8nrOuu_-LoNX1HURA0_wGbBzO19ASQnIJuju3wk5b1WsW6OO0EKjtRDmPGSOqSNB9JZiTunUgEoW7nDeqOKbBj76B9Jau3rhQvHNyzbh3FPj8kfNCCtv63xzHfflIi712yfw5JVo6tO3GUhfT1X7aW62Fj1kWQf64GfeTWqpXTEaI3DSNeO5-D5sDqag1bVT2VCsXzMCDbBXTDq3JJEgIY8y2ga5OiouTht4Lj0Y_EQX1j7webyXU-VR8AWGec7443UljCeeFZp5JyQ/4iz/P_mNAVcDQOi6qh17J_JFxA/h32/h001.3stgqPsmkEg9sbLxXbZ5zshD3jGA-3OVqjGEhg6bbYs) that its Qwen3 models have been upgraded with ultra-long context capabilities of up to 1M tokens.\n\n**Anthropic** [**unveiled**](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.6k0_SAz8nrOuu_-LoNX1HRvW9VP5rEYS4Ejtilvh9TA0JDWsqrvJ-9sKCHsQtX_FHoSDMvGyj4o0EUzlASUlixPLlKisU2DZwR9KC8eXwoArP1FcMCgmv4AHMZ-C28lgdVlgzA3PHJTmM9YvXWiGdPCJWPzO0d7H2SSfG6rEcsG91pR1huu3ZARBp-56N3SBDHhszxHcpeWQn-l1hSh9OP-MLABp-EDrqt6HnLRcG3LBYuKjpOvAsSX14x6hrJY5stUzmCkmPKKkEYuDsJHT6g/4iz/P_mNAVcDQOi6qh17J_JFxA/h33/h001.5Q4lf5nOa8SIEOuhFJhbd0_v1uyqPPDqxD0x1FHpXAY) new memory capabilities in Claude for Max, Team, and Enterprise users (excluding the Pro tier), giving the ability to reference previous chats.\n\n# 🔹 Everyone’s talking about AI.

While the original Cosmos models focused on generating synthetic video data, the new Cosmos Reason takes a different approach — it's designed to actually understand what's happening in physical spaces and plan accordingly.\n\nThe latest releases include Cosmos Transfer-2 for faster synthetic data generation and a distilled version optimized for speed. But Cosmos Reason is the standout, promising to help robots and AI agents think through spatial problems like predicting when \"a person stepping into a crosswalk or a box falling from a shelf\" might happen.\n\nThis represents Nvidia's continued push into what it calls \"physical AI\" where they are trying to bridge the gap between AI that works well with text and images, and AI that can actually navigate and manipulate the real world. Robotics companies have been struggling with the expensive process of collecting enough real-world training data to make their systems reliable.\n\nCompanies like[ 1X, Skild AI, and others](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.929jZiiRht9qZPYC5Z_-teSzLBSf_0iauhguQ-NLnIvbn3lBCR30smWoEbzKJZ-WyUka0SfMJUCdBRl5WDHKgIQ_8RUIae0FoTnp17H2yj8t-IhkKaFW9On1BYE7SeeQx8Z8Wyhm9Y2-ZQp-5ivDe1C29jjqHgAI5EVLIGYEUG_nxIFXJzXBMuRAPrd1QYfxXIvJdbQeI5BD3NOR2fm6vl3GrgPcmYXQ0Lc28foH4GAiG3_xCYlq9orP_mWs35ukxOLt-r0Q7Pi9lHGwH_-5JljTQLYhaAyTFsffIibfLQiXZHdOFCDmcxa_T4bRtMnp2ravS5aD61GtCir6fPM4RqrYixrYtYgb1ABBauVUnwntXzG707yf7hHi5GOCcWdUw3U4oFAUmshXoTneW_OAbw/4iz/mea5FqgBThC194ay-sz2kQ/h26/h001.pKF_MaUTUIc_iquCuNxyHdaBrQ4TqB_HhejcMf5KC-A) are already testing Cosmos models, suggesting there's real demand for tools that can generate physics-aware synthetic data rather than forcing developers to film thousands of hours of robot footage.\n\nThe models are available through Nvidia's API catalog and can be downloaded from [Hugging Face](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.qNCZjjYQy9oQCZ7BSSPG-M40R4VPY45QdAKjwG_YMQHS3Xv5oN3w2TS4s0t9oauGcDGluVqFz8NLHU_waPt3WeF34nIPBins1tUxhSqoAUdcLfvPSY-ADGWfkB_lNleBbkkUEOEwxEXy2ydBD8-QaX2nFU1__sQJbEGQrmIfClGS4qFlAPRbtkpW-jTnnPT7KkJgylYX44gf0ro8kKdd2jyQIDVtvHJzcJ9nk5Ppfi5r-zGVFpSpaNVZh5VhyNHj9lZTwEnjgQALt22TFpbvmw/4iz/mea5FqgBThC194ay-sz2kQ/h27/h001.jl77PyeGucVJ3sVZIIta5TxDtAERP7FUPwbJvv3mWUo), continuing the company's strategy of making advanced AI infrastructure accessible while positioning itself as the essential platform for the next wave of robotics development.\n\n\n\n# 🛑 China urges firms not to use Nvidia H20\n\n* Chinese authorities are discouraging local companies from using Nvidia’s H20 chips, demanding firms justify orders over domestic alternatives and raising questions about potential hardware security issues.\n* Officials in Beijing are worried the processors could have location-tracking and remote shutdown capabilities, a specific concern that Nvidia has strenuously denied in recent statements to the press.\n* The government's push also targets AMD's MI308 accelerators as part of a wider state-led effort to develop homegrown semiconductor capabilities and reduce reliance on Western technology.\n\n# 🧠 Meta’s AI predicts brain responses to videos,\n\nMeta’s FAIR team just [**introduced**](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.6k0_SAz8nrOuu_-LoNX1Ha_P2AeSK-zqDihiqefKUPJ1A4px-JhkIH570mvYMcg-YRD-Xu5Acf8UHA-q0a1YFtxZ-A2BdSnjzKUq1-AwyXFPMVoXoT4qcCvfk-VuHfFN65YqwM7uyRYDTHWLGa3Z1vbMhAOo4nXuh5CdXGQUYz0Qli-8juJxtcx3HNJypEz4YqWqm8K8lQZSi-lAMzo4FCM11saEDIYkt-b0_i8FB53kImvNuwqYYCm3mBoIR4_zLaybSk4rH6MOt3FGlD_w_g/4iz/P_mNAVcDQOi6qh17J_JFxA/h7/h001.zfmJ0WX81wvrtskol2bDozyv_tk2A9hYDufhhA1FUGk) TRIBE, a 1B parameter neural network that predicts how human brains respond to movies by analyzing video, audio, and text — achieving first place in the Algonauts 2025 brain modeling competition.\n\n**The details:**\n\n* TRIBE analyzes video, audio, and dialogue from movies, accurately predicting which of the viewer’s brain regions will activate without any brain scanning.\n* The AI correctly predicted over half brain activity patterns across 1,000 brain regions after training on subjects who watched 80 hours of TV and movies.\n* It works best in brain areas where sight, sound, and language merge, outperforming single-sense models by 30%.\n* Meta's system also showed particular accuracy in frontal brain regions that control attention, decision-making, and emotional responses to content.\n\n**What it means:** We’ve only uncovered the tip of the iceberg when it comes to understanding the brain and its processes, and TRIBE and other AI systems are ramping up that knowledge.

In a hype war where perception is product, Grok 4 just took a branding loss it can’t spin.\n\n**Key takeaway:** In AI chess, as in AI marketing, one bad night can hand your rival a year’s worth of victory ads.\n\n# What Else Happened in AI on August 12th 2025?\n\n**Chinese AI lab Z AI** [**released**](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.siHJl2oxYc5G1hfeCOvt3e9nIxabv3onLCOtgHJhDn4VrrYCgsXHJhAu9Bi1jYiXiHPqHYYiLLGhNJRTtgDZsSITL8zkGgJiWgBDr0Sr0TY49OII2LAF_Zboc86h9XYYmPzNZa8IJD6i_y60MEf9oWkiQWFtgEkGLHdKNBemGLWD0HhSgTkYdrRExuNF4CSt3gcJLxoS8InQ6mn8WuFNKcRfc7FtP9x8nJUS-eF7Uef6ZaZnetpd1a8GCXM2T_Vg/4iz/P_mNAVcDQOi6qh17J_JFxA/h28/h001.zVEO2jGLSYBlrArTgzDV8zHgLqKyOMSBFpkli6F0kC0) GLM-4.5V, a new open-source visual reasoning model that achieves top scores on over 40 different benchmarks.\n\n**GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke** [**announced**](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.6k0_SAz8nrOuu_-LoNX1HcwduSS0zPmX09KBZjjx3ZzBs4ymFGHXnKZaF1I3Nc727WjjeKDIEwHbwO8nO7UYSykouFgnso8qM07Wer51doPYFGz5cECYNtbTJqDeN-IkfcaWrHp8hTs1nuzHrdi0h6b82CAGr3vtXOyf-8KGc94gVdc7LWxoIWztNJVP5be6Dz00cPOuxcdcKRpggx4LsXtjXMkR2zAD_n79D90awZvsmqCbagyN4xMjc4mLBIchsV1h4W5oF_ez2JxObfFOJg/4iz/P_mNAVcDQOi6qh17J_JFxA/h29/h001.5jKcUTayRfPUMN_USOia7l5IhFDXH9Gao-edtU5D57c) that he is leaving the company to pursue his own startup, with GitHub now being woven into Microsoft’s CoreAI department.\n\n**The U.S. government** is reportedly [**set to enter**](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.dSnm3kaGd0BkNqLYPjeMfz3sRxipJonf99jMXlaKZFcHW4edPZxPRbycqkJl01kXThJXy1nVKoSknz1WL23movlxNbZodBw9R0oCfp40AS4qxPjIfFgU36vfZeTUQzgSOaFBHF_EpUBa0KzsZ1ym66rpbaMZoajgCBc_EpeZ33G9mMYSvpzdq9BST87mTTmjEDaQZKpfuTsOEqtMpdhfEXqaCiYlN6GE78krBlV1adAEQ4cS8L3IJbUIBKDkeSWNsQriP3w32wpux6potMN9bUaKfE-DVynjUDtxNgtxgcie9vVY4Du6IeKwm0xqwwn_/4iz/P_mNAVcDQOi6qh17J_JFxA/h30/h001.2fTm1KUfe0ZTo14iZNf8ZOGdPuUXbCGPf7IIn81bXow) into a new agreement with chipmakers Nvidia and AMD that would provide a 15% cut of chip sales to China.\n\n**Pika Labs** [**introduced**](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.6k0_SAz8nrOuu_-LoNX1Heh_niAXJ2AISUQPGpp8W5eblJeN_OfiIlJbwMfiAxwcGy1gf59bcbctPaRifKY0IxAbiLUDmYzlfhzbEvVlR9IVeWOwrH2qX6iZnyYwa1neQ2af1gW1G71vN-2La9y4NtjD9CX5ZfuJHnCw2lY6PC_0wEjMqOK983Ws7uDcmedvN9hNWa1cM899PmW4syhnRTEnZdlVe-rki65Yj9Y0MQzIw_NxWQYf0lR9VfcTgz1XjBBaPg6j8eqyu9xUNI20gg/4iz/P_mNAVcDQOi6qh17J_JFxA/h31/h001.L7a386uqRUi0BUbmiblRxBgKR0LhP5taf703QRch_D0) a new video model rolling out to its social app, with the ability to generate HD-quality outputs with lip-sync and audio in six seconds or less.\n\n**Alibaba** [**announced**](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.6k0_SAz8nrOuu_-LoNX1HURA0_wGbBzO19ASQnIJuju3wk5b1WsW6OO0EKjtRDmPGSOqSNB9JZiTunUgEoW7nDeqOKbBj76B9Jau3rhQvHNyzbh3FPj8kfNCCtv63xzHfflIi712yfw5JVo6tO3GUhfT1X7aW62Fj1kWQf64GfeTWqpXTEaI3DSNeO5-D5sDqag1bVT2VCsXzMCDbBXTDq3JJEgIY8y2ga5OiouTht4Lj0Y_EQX1j7webyXU-VR8AWGec7443UljCeeFZp5JyQ/4iz/P_mNAVcDQOi6qh17J_JFxA/h32/h001.3stgqPsmkEg9sbLxXbZ5zshD3jGA-3OVqjGEhg6bbYs) that its Qwen3 models have been upgraded with ultra-long context capabilities of up to 1M tokens.\n\n**Anthropic** [**unveiled**](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.6k0_SAz8nrOuu_-LoNX1HRvW9VP5rEYS4Ejtilvh9TA0JDWsqrvJ-9sKCHsQtX_FHoSDMvGyj4o0EUzlASUlixPLlKisU2DZwR9KC8eXwoArP1FcMCgmv4AHMZ-C28lgdVlgzA3PHJTmM9YvXWiGdPCJWPzO0d7H2SSfG6rEcsG91pR1huu3ZARBp-56N3SBDHhszxHcpeWQn-l1hSh9OP-MLABp-EDrqt6HnLRcG3LBYuKjpOvAsSX14x6hrJY5stUzmCkmPKKkEYuDsJHT6g/4iz/P_mNAVcDQOi6qh17J_JFxA/h33/h001.5Q4lf5nOa8SIEOuhFJhbd0_v1uyqPPDqxD0x1FHpXAY) new memory capabilities in Claude for Max, Team, and Enterprise users (excluding the Pro tier), giving the ability to reference previous chats.\n\n# 🔹 Everyone’s talking about AI.

While the original Cosmos models focused on generating synthetic video data, the new Cosmos Reason takes a different approach — it's designed to actually understand what's happening in physical spaces and plan accordingly.\n\nThe latest releases include Cosmos Transfer-2 for faster synthetic data generation and a distilled version optimized for speed. But Cosmos Reason is the standout, promising to help robots and AI agents think through spatial problems like predicting when \"a person stepping into a crosswalk or a box falling from a shelf\" might happen.\n\nThis represents Nvidia's continued push into what it calls \"physical AI\" where they are trying to bridge the gap between AI that works well with text and images, and AI that can actually navigate and manipulate the real world. Robotics companies have been struggling with the expensive process of collecting enough real-world training data to make their systems reliable.\n\nCompanies like[ 1X, Skild AI, and others](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.929jZiiRht9qZPYC5Z_-teSzLBSf_0iauhguQ-NLnIvbn3lBCR30smWoEbzKJZ-WyUka0SfMJUCdBRl5WDHKgIQ_8RUIae0FoTnp17H2yj8t-IhkKaFW9On1BYE7SeeQx8Z8Wyhm9Y2-ZQp-5ivDe1C29jjqHgAI5EVLIGYEUG_nxIFXJzXBMuRAPrd1QYfxXIvJdbQeI5BD3NOR2fm6vl3GrgPcmYXQ0Lc28foH4GAiG3_xCYlq9orP_mWs35ukxOLt-r0Q7Pi9lHGwH_-5JljTQLYhaAyTFsffIibfLQiXZHdOFCDmcxa_T4bRtMnp2ravS5aD61GtCir6fPM4RqrYixrYtYgb1ABBauVUnwntXzG707yf7hHi5GOCcWdUw3U4oFAUmshXoTneW_OAbw/4iz/mea5FqgBThC194ay-sz2kQ/h26/h001.pKF_MaUTUIc_iquCuNxyHdaBrQ4TqB_HhejcMf5KC-A) are already testing Cosmos models, suggesting there's real demand for tools that can generate physics-aware synthetic data rather than forcing developers to film thousands of hours of robot footage.\n\nThe models are available through Nvidia's API catalog and can be downloaded from [Hugging Face](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.qNCZjjYQy9oQCZ7BSSPG-M40R4VPY45QdAKjwG_YMQHS3Xv5oN3w2TS4s0t9oauGcDGluVqFz8NLHU_waPt3WeF34nIPBins1tUxhSqoAUdcLfvPSY-ADGWfkB_lNleBbkkUEOEwxEXy2ydBD8-QaX2nFU1__sQJbEGQrmIfClGS4qFlAPRbtkpW-jTnnPT7KkJgylYX44gf0ro8kKdd2jyQIDVtvHJzcJ9nk5Ppfi5r-zGVFpSpaNVZh5VhyNHj9lZTwEnjgQALt22TFpbvmw/4iz/mea5FqgBThC194ay-sz2kQ/h27/h001.jl77PyeGucVJ3sVZIIta5TxDtAERP7FUPwbJvv3mWUo), continuing the company's strategy of making advanced AI infrastructure accessible while positioning itself as the essential platform for the next wave of robotics development.\n\n\n\n# 🛑 China urges firms not to use Nvidia H20\n\n* Chinese authorities are discouraging local companies from using Nvidia’s H20 chips, demanding firms justify orders over domestic alternatives and raising questions about potential hardware security issues.\n* Officials in Beijing are worried the processors could have location-tracking and remote shutdown capabilities, a specific concern that Nvidia has strenuously denied in recent statements to the press.\n* The government's push also targets AMD's MI308 accelerators as part of a wider state-led effort to develop homegrown semiconductor capabilities and reduce reliance on Western technology.\n\n# 🧠 Meta’s AI predicts brain responses to videos,\n\nMeta’s FAIR team just [**introduced**](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.6k0_SAz8nrOuu_-LoNX1Ha_P2AeSK-zqDihiqefKUPJ1A4px-JhkIH570mvYMcg-YRD-Xu5Acf8UHA-q0a1YFtxZ-A2BdSnjzKUq1-AwyXFPMVoXoT4qcCvfk-VuHfFN65YqwM7uyRYDTHWLGa3Z1vbMhAOo4nXuh5CdXGQUYz0Qli-8juJxtcx3HNJypEz4YqWqm8K8lQZSi-lAMzo4FCM11saEDIYkt-b0_i8FB53kImvNuwqYYCm3mBoIR4_zLaybSk4rH6MOt3FGlD_w_g/4iz/P_mNAVcDQOi6qh17J_JFxA/h7/h001.zfmJ0WX81wvrtskol2bDozyv_tk2A9hYDufhhA1FUGk) TRIBE, a 1B parameter neural network that predicts how human brains respond to movies by analyzing video, audio, and text — achieving first place in the Algonauts 2025 brain modeling competition.\n\n**The details:**\n\n* TRIBE analyzes video, audio, and dialogue from movies, accurately predicting which of the viewer’s brain regions will activate without any brain scanning.\n* The AI correctly predicted over half brain activity patterns across 1,000 brain regions after training on subjects who watched 80 hours of TV and movies.\n* It works best in brain areas where sight, sound, and language merge, outperforming single-sense models by 30%.\n* Meta's system also showed particular accuracy in frontal brain regions that control attention, decision-making, and emotional responses to content.\n\n**What it means:** We’ve only uncovered the tip of the iceberg when it comes to understanding the brain and its processes, and TRIBE and other AI systems are ramping up that knowledge. But they are also providing new formulas for maximizing attention on a neural level, potentially making doomscrolling even more irresistible.\n\n# 🏅 OpenAI's reasoner snags gold at programming olympiad\n\nOpenAI [**announced**](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.6k0_SAz8nrOuu_-LoNX1HaSIRI5hsnO_wp34T44KIz6-H34vwfUtR_AF405dy_4Al_oY8J6TRUO4CXzt-TSJiCvDdnnSEduqakX3S9BakIzQ8v0xPrgVqrefepktFcSGUmrocB0Q-F2d_pEkaiIw34Qrtqsn3QTzjpYUt7nvXemsRKpwhfMl20wD1wke9CKJD9ARLd3nGmaEY_BuH0lz_uRC3-HC9ahkpHEnwKQXKawCXv-l9jQ8tcW5KlZSfd40pi5fwQO3bF-rhLadAKlPNA/4iz/P_mNAVcDQOi6qh17J_JFxA/h13/h001.-AJzKI8qwEy5s_UTYxyQIh97rdxTEu1aZHOQ0zQLPRo) that its reasoning model achieved a gold-level score at the 2025 International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI), placing 6th against humans and first among AI in the world’s top pre-college programming competition.\n\n**The details:**\n\n* The AI competed against top student programmers worldwide, solving coding problems with the same time and submission limits as human contestants.\n* OpenAI’s model was a general-purpose reasoner, without specific fine-tuning for programming and relying on just basic tools.\n* The system scored in the 98th percentile, a massive jump from a 49% score just a year ago.\n* The same model also won gold at the International Math Olympiad and AtCoder, showing strength across a range of complex problem-solving areas.\n\n**What it means:** The 2x leap in score shows how fast reasoning capabilities have truly moved over the past year. The days of humans ahead of AI in competitions are numbered, and these achievements will likely be the stepping stones towards future models that are capable of discovering new science, math, physics, and more.\n\n\n\n# 💊 Korean researchers’ AI designs cancer drugs\n\nResearchers at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science &amp; Technology (KAIST) [**developed**](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.dSnm3kaGd0BkNqLYPjeMfxihQCl5g2YxDMYMm0AMA8rBgrbnteAOhFux9Gv8LTEYYr-uLuSA9jFzxQM_KC-8ss1sZnZg0VPypcd5t9ehgDMpAfCuPxQ-Ssvb6fTsAaNndlWfXKELSreRYL31Ndqu3GEeVNdDOVVxl6jN9plMgOZNbMhupWQIexqmC1NHb2tm4WWzZaPlVATdLtWYcyliUnEs7PH5kFGGWC5p_DD6qtiI2FXDPIL-8sM-6o1RhvAeajEgWUwECAIcw0RBJIgYaFCcN_xb3CJLyzuVBtvOK_NEkGjt1ju1YZdT0aA-W8QgGzoNFShQeA3yVRZOSdHfLp5_YiX85TZyhOKQUjVMjzxFVSvqIWhsvsLANwFrJzZuT_kG19V2pn4NzK5T5urHWA/4iz/P_mNAVcDQOi6qh17J_JFxA/h21/h001.JzPqLV1q7NBgnfeanTu9QWb03MIRN63yleK8mEa4DoQ) BInD, a new diffusion model that designs optimal cancer drug candidates from scratch without any prior molecular data or training examples.\n\n**The details:**\n\n* The AI designs both the drug molecule and how it will attach to diseased proteins in one step, rather than creating and then testing in multiple iterations.\n* BInD created drugs that target only cancer-causing protein mutations while leaving healthy versions alone, showing precision medicine capabilities.\n* Unlike older AI systems that could only optimize for one criterion at a time, BInD ensures drugs are safe, stable, and possible to manufacture all at once.\n* The model also learns from its successes, reusing winning strategies with a recycling technique to design better drugs without starting from scratch.\n\n**Why it matters:** Drug discovery continues to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of AI acceleration. While the first AI-designed drugs are just starting to come to market, it feels like we’re only a few steps away from the floodgates opening on humanity-altering medicine advances designed by advanced AI models.\n\n\n\n# 🤖 xAI Makes Grok 4 Free Globally, Days After GPT-5 Launch\n\nElon Musk’s company xAI has made its AI model Grok 4 freely accessible to users around the world for a limited time—a tactical move closely following OpenAI’s GPT-5 release.

The culprit? Inconsistency. Even with DeepThink reasoning boosts, these systems are elite in some domains and embarrassingly brittle in others. Sundar Pichai’s AJI label is now the polite way to say “brilliant idiot.”\n\n**How this hits reality:** AJI isn’t a half-step to AGI—it’s a chasm. Closing it means more than shoving GPUs and data at the problem; it requires breakthroughs in reasoning, planning, and memory. For teams betting on near-term AGI, this is a [**cold shower**](https://aisecret.us/r/a94df255?m=75fe0f74-46b6-4618-9375-07821bf777c6): your “almost there” model may still hallucinate its way out of a paper bag.\n\n**Key takeaway:** AGI isn’t just “more AJI”—it’s a different beast. And right now, the beast is missing teeth.\n\n# Claude’s Memory Goes Selective—And That’s the Point\n\n**What’s happening:** Anthropic rolled out a “search-and-reference” memory for Claude, letting users pull past chats on demand. It works across devices, keeps projects siloed, and never builds a persistent user profile. Unlike OpenAI’s always-on memory, Claude won’t “remember” unless [**explicitly asked**](https://aisecret.us/r/c029a694?m=75fe0f74-46b6-4618-9375-07821bf777c6) — no silent data hoarding, no surprise callbacks.\n\n**How this hits reality:** For enterprise buyers and compliance teams, Claude’s opt-in recall is a feature, not a bug. It sidesteps privacy backlash, keeps audit trails clean, and reduces the risk of unintentional behavioral profiling. OpenAI’s default-on approach gives richer personalization but also a bigger [**regulatory attack surface**](https://aisecret.us/r/354b005a?m=75fe0f74-46b6-4618-9375-07821bf777c6). In a market already twitchy about AI “overfamiliarity,” Anthropic just handed security teams an easy win.\n\n**Key takeaway:** Claude remembers only when told — turning “forgetfulness” into a trust moat OpenAI can’t claim.\n\n# Grok 4’s Chess Loss Is a PR Bloodbath for Musk\n\nPhoto by: kaggle\n\n**What’s happening:** While Elon Musk was busy telling Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella on GPT-5 launch day that OpenAI would “[**eat Microsoft alive**](https://aisecret.us/r/f75925be?m=75fe0f74-46b6-4618-9375-07821bf777c6),” his own LLM, Grok 4, was being eaten alive — 4–0 — by OpenAI’s o3 in a live-streamed Google Kaggle AI chess showdown. The kicker? Five-time world champion Magnus Carlsen was live on mic, laughing, face-palming, and likening Grok’s blunders to “kids’ games” and club amateurs who only know openings.\n\n**How this hits reality:** Forget Kaggle rankings — this was a [**marketing assassination**](https://aisecret.us/r/992e86e5?m=75fe0f74-46b6-4618-9375-07821bf777c6). In an arena meant to showcase AI prowess, Grok’s collapse gave OpenAI a free highlight reel of dominance, complete with the world’s best chess player laughing at Musk’s flagship model. In a hype war where perception is product, Grok 4 just took a branding loss it can’t spin.\n\n**Key takeaway:** In AI chess, as in AI marketing, one bad night can hand your rival a year’s worth of victory ads.\n\n# What Else Happened in AI on August 12th 2025?\n\n**Chinese AI lab Z AI** [**released**](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.siHJl2oxYc5G1hfeCOvt3e9nIxabv3onLCOtgHJhDn4VrrYCgsXHJhAu9Bi1jYiXiHPqHYYiLLGhNJRTtgDZsSITL8zkGgJiWgBDr0Sr0TY49OII2LAF_Zboc86h9XYYmPzNZa8IJD6i_y60MEf9oWkiQWFtgEkGLHdKNBemGLWD0HhSgTkYdrRExuNF4CSt3gcJLxoS8InQ6mn8WuFNKcRfc7FtP9x8nJUS-eF7Uef6ZaZnetpd1a8GCXM2T_Vg/4iz/P_mNAVcDQOi6qh17J_JFxA/h28/h001.zVEO2jGLSYBlrArTgzDV8zHgLqKyOMSBFpkli6F0kC0) GLM-4.5V, a new open-source visual reasoning model that achieves top scores on over 40 different benchmarks.\n\n**GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke** [**announced**](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.6k0_SAz8nrOuu_-LoNX1HcwduSS0zPmX09KBZjjx3ZzBs4ymFGHXnKZaF1I3Nc727WjjeKDIEwHbwO8nO7UYSykouFgnso8qM07Wer51doPYFGz5cECYNtbTJqDeN-IkfcaWrHp8hTs1nuzHrdi0h6b82CAGr3vtXOyf-8KGc94gVdc7LWxoIWztNJVP5be6Dz00cPOuxcdcKRpggx4LsXtjXMkR2zAD_n79D90awZvsmqCbagyN4xMjc4mLBIchsV1h4W5oF_ez2JxObfFOJg/4iz/P_mNAVcDQOi6qh17J_JFxA/h29/h001.5jKcUTayRfPUMN_USOia7l5IhFDXH9Gao-edtU5D57c) that he is leaving the company to pursue his own startup, with GitHub now being woven into Microsoft’s CoreAI department.\n\n**The U.S. government** is reportedly [**set to enter**](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.dSnm3kaGd0BkNqLYPjeMfz3sRxipJonf99jMXlaKZFcHW4edPZxPRbycqkJl01kXThJXy1nVKoSknz1WL23movlxNbZodBw9R0oCfp40AS4qxPjIfFgU36vfZeTUQzgSOaFBHF_EpUBa0KzsZ1ym66rpbaMZoajgCBc_EpeZ33G9mMYSvpzdq9BST87mTTmjEDaQZKpfuTsOEqtMpdhfEXqaCiYlN6GE78krBlV1adAEQ4cS8L3IJbUIBKDkeSWNsQriP3w32wpux6potMN9bUaKfE-DVynjUDtxNgtxgcie9vVY4Du6IeKwm0xqwwn_/4iz/P_mNAVcDQOi6qh17J_JFxA/h30/h001.2fTm1KUfe0ZTo14iZNf8ZOGdPuUXbCGPf7IIn81bXow) into a new agreement with chipmakers Nvidia and AMD that would provide a 15% cut of chip sales to China.\n\n**Pika Labs** [**introduced**](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.6k0_SAz8nrOuu_-LoNX1Heh_niAXJ2AISUQPGpp8W5eblJeN_OfiIlJbwMfiAxwcGy1gf59bcbctPaRifKY0IxAbiLUDmYzlfhzbEvVlR9IVeWOwrH2qX6iZnyYwa1neQ2af1gW1G71vN-2La9y4NtjD9CX5ZfuJHnCw2lY6PC_0wEjMqOK983Ws7uDcmedvN9hNWa1cM899PmW4syhnRTEnZdlVe-rki65Yj9Y0MQzIw_NxWQYf0lR9VfcTgz1XjBBaPg6j8eqyu9xUNI20gg/4iz/P_mNAVcDQOi6qh17J_JFxA/h31/h001.L7a386uqRUi0BUbmiblRxBgKR0LhP5taf703QRch_D0) a new video model rolling out to its social app, with the ability to generate HD-quality outputs with lip-sync and audio in six seconds or less.\n\n**Alibaba** [**announced**](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.6k0_SAz8nrOuu_-LoNX1HURA0_wGbBzO19ASQnIJuju3wk5b1WsW6OO0EKjtRDmPGSOqSNB9JZiTunUgEoW7nDeqOKbBj76B9Jau3rhQvHNyzbh3FPj8kfNCCtv63xzHfflIi712yfw5JVo6tO3GUhfT1X7aW62Fj1kWQf64GfeTWqpXTEaI3DSNeO5-D5sDqag1bVT2VCsXzMCDbBXTDq3JJEgIY8y2ga5OiouTht4Lj0Y_EQX1j7webyXU-VR8AWGec7443UljCeeFZp5JyQ/4iz/P_mNAVcDQOi6qh17J_JFxA/h32/h001.3stgqPsmkEg9sbLxXbZ5zshD3jGA-3OVqjGEhg6bbYs) that its Qwen3 models have been upgraded with ultra-long context capabilities of up to 1M tokens.\n\n**Anthropic** [**unveiled**](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.6k0_SAz8nrOuu_-LoNX1HRvW9VP5rEYS4Ejtilvh9TA0JDWsqrvJ-9sKCHsQtX_FHoSDMvGyj4o0EUzlASUlixPLlKisU2DZwR9KC8eXwoArP1FcMCgmv4AHMZ-C28lgdVlgzA3PHJTmM9YvXWiGdPCJWPzO0d7H2SSfG6rEcsG91pR1huu3ZARBp-56N3SBDHhszxHcpeWQn-l1hSh9OP-MLABp-EDrqt6HnLRcG3LBYuKjpOvAsSX14x6hrJY5stUzmCkmPKKkEYuDsJHT6g/4iz/P_mNAVcDQOi6qh17J_JFxA/h33/h001.5Q4lf5nOa8SIEOuhFJhbd0_v1uyqPPDqxD0x1FHpXAY) new memory capabilities in Claude for Max, Team, and Enterprise users (excluding the Pro tier), giving the ability to reference previous chats.\n\n# 🔹 Everyone’s talking about AI.

For fans of narrative adventures with a touch of Nordic fantasy, this game delivers exactly what it promises: an emotional story wrapped in dreamlike landscapes. Myrkur Games has planted the seeds of something special, and I’m genuinely excited to see how it blossoms in future projects.\n\n[**GAMES.CH**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/762/games-ch) \\- [Fabrice Henz](https://opencritic.com/critic/10462/fabrice-henz) \\- *German* \\- [79%](https://www.games.ch/echoes-of-the-end/test/review-my6/)\n\n&gt;With \"Echoes of the End,\" Myrkur Games delivers a compelling debut. While there's still plenty of room for improvement in most areas, especially the gameplay, as a whole it's a fantastic experience. Carried by its compelling fantasy world and human characters, it offers a very linear but highly entertaining blend of multiple genres. It may not win any major awards, but the fun is there if you overlook many minor issues and battle your way through to the even better second half of the game.\n\n[**GameOnly**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/912/gameonly) \\- [Michał Marasek](https://opencritic.com/critic/10763/micha-marasek) \\- *Polish* \\- [3 / 5 ](https://gameonly.pl/recenzja/recenzja-echoes-of-the-end-mamy-god-of-war-w-domu)\n\n&gt;Echoes of the End is a very ambitious but, unfortunately, very unpolished project. The combat and puzzles are decent, but ultimately not good enough to carry the sheer amount of them we get here. The story isn’t exactly gripping. The best part is the scenery, overflowing with Icelandic atmosphere. As a debut project, it’s a solid effort. If we get some technical improvements, Echoes of the End could be a pleasant mid-tier game for a few hours of enjoyable play.\n\n[**Generación Xbox**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/431/generaci-n-xbox) \\- *Spanish* \\- [81 / 100](https://generacionxbox.com/analisis-de-echoes-of-the-end-larga-vida-a-los-juegos-doble-a/)\n\n&gt;Visually, it's remarkable, its soundtrack fits well within the game, and its approach blends action, story, and exploration well. There's room for improvement in the technical aspects and in the variety of some stages, but the final feeling is that of having experienced an adventure with personality. That's why I highlight these A-list games, which fill in the gaps that others don't.\n\n[**IGN Spain**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/471/ign-spain) \\- Mario Sánchez - *Spanish* \\- [5 / 10](https://es.ign.com/echoes-of-the-end/219842/review/analisis-de-ecohes-of-the-end-un-juego-con-gran-potencial-pero-lastrado-por-sus-errores-y-su-diseno)\n\n&gt;Echoes of the End is a third-person action-adventure game with interesting puzzles and challenging combat. Although its mechanics have potential, the title fails to make good use of them, and it also suffers from technical issues and poor overall design.\n\n[**Impulsegamer**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/31/impulsegamer) \\- [Chris O'Connor](https://opencritic.com/critic/1394/chris-oconnor) \\- [4.1 / 5](https://www.impulsegamer.com/echoes-of-the-end-pc-review/)\n\n&gt;Echoes Of The End does have a lot of good points. Visually it does not disappoint, the magic can be fun to wield, and the puzzles add a nice little change of pace. The combat is generally enjoyable enough, if a little awkward, especially targeting magic abilities with camera angles in the midst of battle. If you can put up with its little quirks and occasional glitches (I once seemed to manage to get myself stuck inside the landscape and was unable to move or even see the world properly), it does offer a nice little bit of fantasy storytelling and might be worth your while. If you are easily frustrated by games that sometimes seem to work against you, maybe give it a miss.\n\n[**Loot Level Chill**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/948/loot-level-chill) \\- [Mick Fraser](https://opencritic.com/critic/572/mick-fraser) \\- [7 / 10](https://lootlevelchill.com/reviews/echoes-of-the-end-review)\n\n&gt;Nothing about Echoes of the End is original, but it’s worth a look if you’re a fan of flashy action and environmental puzzles.\n\n[**Quest Daily**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/905/quest-daily) \\- [Nathanael Peacock](https://opencritic.com/critic/5876/nathanael-peacock) \\- [6.5 / 10](https://questdaily.com.au/review/review-echoes-of-the-end-pc/)\n\n&gt;Echoes of the End takes some big swings with its original fantasy world, gorgeous visuals, and solid third-person puzzles and combat. At the same time, it’s hampered by technical issues and a 13-hour story that — while short — still manages to feel padded in places.\n\n[**SteamDeckHQ**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/920/steamdeckhq) \\- [Noah Kupetsky](https://opencritic.com/critic/10844/noah-kupetsky) \\- [3.5 / 5 ](https://steamdeckhq.com/game-reviews/echoes-of-the-end/)\n\n&gt;Echoes of the End is a solid production, but it just has many instances that take me out of the immersion. It's small things here and there, but in the end, it's enough to make the experience suffer. When the mechanics work together, it feels fantastic, and the visuals are top-notch, but when it doesn't work, it is frustrating and made me want to stop playing. The story is intriguing as well, even if the voice acting was off and plot was predictable.\n\n[**The Beta Network**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/844/the-beta-network) \\- [Anthony Culinas](https://opencritic.com/critic/8928/anthony-culinas) \\- [7 / 10](https://thebetanetwork.net/articles/echoes-of-the-end-review/)\n\n&gt;Echoes of the End is a quirky, Icelandic-themed adventure blending awesome platforming, puzzles and decent combat, inspired by some of the biggest names in gaming. Its imagination and variety are impressive for a first-time dev, but the constant bugs, wonky animations and inconsistent sound design stop it from reaching its full potential. Though as the ending leaves things open for a sequel, hopefully they can come back and edge closer to glory.",

As a student trying to stay healthy without the monthly cost, it just wasn’t practical.\n\nSo I built Pump’d — a completely free iOS fitness and macro tracking app with no subscriptions, no locked features, and no upsells.\n\nWhat Pump’d lets you do:\n\n• Track calories and macros with preset or custom goals\n\n• Log food with search, barcode scanner, or nutrition label scan\n\n• Sync with Apple Health to track steps, heart rate, water intake, and calories burned\n\n• Monitor weight, calculate BMI, and view daily/weekly progress\n\n• Use home and lock screen widgets for quick access\n\n• 100% free — no hidden fees, no premium version\n\nI’m also working on adding full workout tracking soon!\n\nIf you’re at UT and want a no-cost, student-friendly app to help you hit your fitness goals, give it a try:\n\nApp Store link:\nhttps://apps.apple.com/us/app/pumpd-fitness/id6740255219\n\nGo Vols!",

    "text_content": "I was at the mart of walls yesterday, doing my biweekly grocery shopping and vibing with some death metal blaring in my hearing aids (bluetooth is amazing).  I noticed a teen probably 18 or maybe even 20 (I'm old forgive me).  I pay no mind and continue shopping in the produce isle looking for Fuji apples first on my list.\n\nThen later I see this same person, empty basket looking confused and that's when I notice they have a cochlear implant.  I get their attention and turn off my music and with my voice ask if they're OK.  He points to his ear and moves his head side to side to tell me he can't hear anything.\n\nI smile and ask \"Do you know ASL?\" in ASL.  His face lit up like morning sunshine and says \"Yes, can you help me?\"  I ask \"What do you need?\"  He says \"This is my first time shopping by myself, where can I find rotel?\"\n\nI introduce him to the Mart of Walls app, give him a show on how I can locate the item and took him right to it.  He downloaded the app and I helped him set things up in the store.\n\nHe thanked me, said \"It's wonderful Mart of Walls hires someone like you.\"  I had a chuckle and told him \"I don't work here, I'm just another deafie like you, just more experience.\"  I laughed, he laughed, the decepticons laughed.  It was a good day.\n\nI went back about my shopping and my new friend has me on Telegram. :)",

    "text_content": "Hi everyone, I wanted to investigate an issue I was having. For context, I work in the Gold Coast area and live in the southwest suburbs.\nSince I started my job earlier this year, driving has not been an issue. On dates that I drive, the GPS is pretty consistent when it comes to giving directions to and from work. For the most part, on any given day, I can know exactly what time I'll be getting home and exactly what route I'll be taking. Save a few minor tweaks to save a minute\n\nLately, particularly this week, l've noticed my GPS sent me in all different types of directions. Every day this week l've had a new route to work and from work.... And all with wildly different ETA. On Monday I had one ETA, I put in my address to the GPS manually instead of just hitting the home button, and even though there's the same exact address, one had an ETA that was 12 minutes earlier. In the mornings, my commute has increased by about 15 minutes, and I'm getting taken to random parts of the city as opposed to just taking my normal route.\n\nHas anyone else noticed this discrepancy? At first, I was trusting the GPS because it usually gives me the fastest way to get home; hence why I was not just taking the normal route that I'm familiar with.\n\nHowever, I'm starting to think it might be a good idea for me to just go on the route I know in the event that Apple maps is not functioning correctly.\nSometimes l'll also put the same route in Google maps and Google maps will get me to my destination",

Or is Arc 140T more than enough for my use case?\n\n\nWould love to hear from anyone who owns either version (or has experience with similar configs) — especially thoughts on thermals, noise, battery life, and GPU switching.\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "text_content": "Microsoft Surface Pro 11 instantly grabbed my attention with its sleek design and advanced features. As someone who works extensively with technology daily, I couldn’t wait to put the Surface Pro 11 through its paces. With its Snapdragon X Plus processor, 16GB of RAM, and Windows 11 Pro operating system, it certainly seems geared toward professionals who demand performance and reliability while on the go.\n\n**Design and Build Quality**  \nThe engineering of this tablet feels top-notch in every sense. The 13-inch PixelSense Flow display looks elite with its thin bezels and nearly edge-to-edge design. Carrying it around feels like holding a feather—at only 1.97 lbs, it's surprisingly light. I appreciate how Microsoft balanced ruggedness with elegance. The black finish gives off a modern vibe, though it does tend to show smudges and fingerprints a bit too easily if you're not careful. The 0.37-inch thickness means it slides into bags without issue, making it perfect for commuting professionals like me.\n\n**Immersive Display Performance**  \nI spend significant time editing photos and videos, so the PixelSense Flow display, boasting a 2880x1920 resolution, had to deliver, and it did. Colors appear vivid, while the contrast ratio of 1200:1 ensures deep blacks. Scrolling through files and navigating with the 120Hz dynamic refresh rate felt ridiculously smooth. Watching videos or even just reading documents is a visually crisp experience. However, in brightly-lit areas, I noticed the screen is not as anti-glare as expected, which might bother some users.\n\n**Highlights**  \n- Lightweight yet durable design perfect for portability  \n- Stunning 13-inch display with high resolution and crisp visuals  \n- Ultra-smooth 120Hz refresh rate for seamless navigation  \n\n[Ready to buy Microsoft Surface Pro 11? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://preciseshop.com/p/b0dlbt8pmn/)\n\n**AI-Powered Performance**  \nThe Snapdragon X Plus processor brings exciting possibilities. Microsoft’s take on AI integrations, like image creation and real-time video translations, works impressively. I tested Microsoft Copilot for basic tasks like scheduling meetings and setting reminders; its speed and accuracy left me impressed. The built-in Qualcomm Adreno GPU ensures that even light gaming and creative workloads, such as 3D rendering or drawing, run without a hitch. \n\nHowever, true power users like creative professionals who deal with heavier workloads might find the AI capabilities handy but not groundbreaking. Despite that, multitasking on this device brings a newfound level of speed and efficiency. Switching between heavy apps felt faster than most tablets I've tested so far.\n\n**Connectivity Options**  \nIn terms of ports, dual USB-C 4 might sound minimalistic, but it’s all about the power they pack. You can connect up to three 4K monitors at the same time! For someone like me, working from my home office often involves multiple displays, so this was a big win. I also appreciated how quickly file transfers went using USB-C. A small limitation here is the lack of a traditional USB-A port, which might frustrate folks who haven't entirely transitioned to Type-C ecosystems yet.\n\n**Product Strengths**  \n- Seamless multitasking powered by Snapdragon X Plus processor  \n- Dual USB-C 4 ports with multi-monitor support—ideal for office setups  \n- AI features streamline daily productivity  \n\n**Battery Life Performance**  \nFor a device that promises so much power, I found the battery life surprisingly commendable. It comfortably lasted through my typical workday, which includes several video calls, web browsing, and working on large presentations. The integrated power efficiency genuinely shines here. Still, on days involving heavier creative use, such as rendering graphics, the battery drains faster, which means you’ll likely need to carry your charger if you're on the move.\n\n**Areas for Improvement**  \n- Expected to include more variety in port options  \n- Screen glare in daylight can hinder outdoor usage  \n- Fast battery depletion under heavy creative workloads  \n\n**Other Options**  \nAs polished as it is, the Surface Pro 11 isn't without challengers in its category. I’ve worked with Apple’s iPad Pro series before, notably the latest M2 variant. While Apple's device often wins in sheer creative software options (like Procreate), the Surface Pro 11 undoubtedly excels in versatility with its Windows 11 Pro integration, offering a full PC experience. Another comparable option might be the Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra, which brings stunning AMOLED visuals, but it doesn’t match the raw AI efficiencies provided by Microsoft's Snapdragon-powered lineup. Choosing between them comes down to whether you're more productivity-focused or swayed by entertainment features.\n\n**Quality for Price Comparison**  \nWith a feature list this packed, I'd term the Surface Pro 11 as a product that intelligently blends price and technology. Devices like these often sit at a premium, but you get your money's worth considering the performance metrics and added benefits. Coupled with its AI-specific functionalities, the tablet feels designed to meet a niche—power users looking to balance professional utility with cutting-edge technology. However, if you're someone focused solely on entertainment or occasional casual use, you might find alternatives that cost less.  \n\n[Check Microsoft Surface Pro 11 price on Amazon.](https://preciseshop.com/p/b0dlbt8pmn/)",

    "text_content": "Testing the VIZIO M558-G1 has been quite the journey, both visually and functionally. From the moment I unboxed this 55-inch 4K HDR Smart TV, it was clear VIZIO took significant strides to create a product that feels premium. As someone who relies on their TV for everything from weekend binge-watching to casual gaming, I had high expectations, and for the most part, this TV delivered.\n\n**Design and Build Quality**  \nThe design is simple but sleek, with slim bezels that make the entire display feel expansive. The black finish pairs well with its minimalist stand, which feels sturdy despite the sleekness. Weighing a substantial 35.7 pounds, moving it around requires some effort, but the payoff is a screen that feels well-built and expensive. Its dimensions—48.59 inches wide and 30.6 inches tall with the stand—fit effortlessly on my entertainment center, leaving just enough room for a soundbar. The flat screen provides a modern aesthetic, but it’s not overly flashy, which I appreciate.\n\n**Picture Quality with Quantum Color**  \nThe quantum color technology VIZIO boasts certainly lives up to the hype. I’ve used other 4K TVs, but this one’s ability to produce 80% more color than standard 4K options genuinely wowed me. Watching wildlife documentaries became a whole new experience, with vibrant shades of green and deep, rich blues breathing life into every scene. The Active Full Array backlight and 90 local dimming zones create astonishing contrast levels and deep blacks. I tested it during a thriller movie, and the details in the darker scenes were impressive, though I did notice slight blooming in very high-contrast shots.\n\n**HDR Performance and Brightness**  \nThe Ultra-Bright 600 feature pushes this TV’s brightness to another level. At up to 600 nits, even daytime viewing in a bright room didn’t wash out the image, which is often a challenge with TVs in this price bracket. HDR10 combined with Dolby Vision added richness to colors and textures—whether I was streaming the latest blockbuster or playing my favorite action RPG on the PlayStation 5.\n\n[Check VIZIO M558-G1 price on Amazon.](https://heatad.com/t/b07rfnww8y/)\n\n**Smart Features: Convenience at Its Best**  \nSmartCast 3.0 is one of the most convenient features of this TV. Without having to rely on extra devices, apps like Netflix and Hulu are already integrated directly into the system. I often switch between watching shows and streaming workouts via Apple Airplay and the built-in Chromecast, which saves me the hassle of switching HDMI inputs. Voice controls using Alexa and Google Assistant are responsive and reliable, though setup took longer than anticipated. Siri compatibility was a plus, especially for other Apple devices in the house.\n\n**Audio Performance**  \nWhile the display is top-tier, the built-in speakers are average. They’re fine for casual TV watching but lack depth, making bass-heavy scenes feel underwhelming. I paired it with a mid-range soundbar, and that made a world of difference, especially for Dolby Atmos content.\n\n**Highlights**  \n- Slim, modern design with sturdy build  \n- Outstanding picture quality with rich, vivid colors  \n- Excellent brightness and contrast levels  \n- SmartCast 3.0 for seamless streaming integration  \n- Apple AirPlay and Chromecast are perfect for sharing content swiftly  \n\n**Areas for Improvement**  \n- Slight blooming on high-contrast visuals  \n- The audio quality could be beefed up for a richer experience  \n- The remote feels outdated, with fewer buttons catering to streaming apps than I’d hope  \n- Initial startup and software updates took longer than expected  \n\n**Product Competitors**  \nWhen comparing this TV to its main competitors, the Samsung Q60T is an immediate rival. While Samsung offers better motion smoothing, making it a favorite for sports enthusiasts, the VIZIO stands out for its price-to-performance ratio and deeper blacks thanks to the local dimming zones. Another challenger, the TCL 6-Series, delivers excellent HDR brightness and comparable quantum dot technology. However, I noticed the VIZIO M558-G1 has slightly more accurate colors. LG's NanoCell series also emerges as tough competition in picture quality but lacks the wide streaming integration VIZIO excels in. \n\n**Value for Money**  \nGiven the price range, the VIZIO M558-G1 offers strong value for features like Dolby Vision, SmartCast, and voice controls. Competing TVs might cost slightly more for similar options, so this one positions itself well for anyone wanting premium features without breaking the bank. While it’s not perfect, the advantages outweigh any minor flaws in its hardware or software, making it a worthwhile investment.\n\n[Want the lowest VIZIO M558-G1 price?

Luke sat down on his chair and took his time to breath in and out, while Vina collapsed on the bed and curled up like an exhausted dog.\n\n“Go to sleep”\n\n“You too…”\n\nLuke wanted to check on his wound, he was worried it opened back up considering he was hit pretty hard. It sounds like Eryn is still awake, strangely enough, it's probably better to ask her to check it.\n\n“Nah, i got something to do real quick”\n\n“Hmph… what is it?”\n\n“Got knocked up by that lady pretty good, reckon i’d check up on this wound to see if there's anything wrong with it”\n\nShe looked at the wound on his stomach, stared at it for a moment, before going wide eyed.\n\n“Oh Gods! Are you-”\n\n“I think so? Gonna need to ask the expert still”\n\n“I’m coming with you…”\n\nShe sounds extremely worried, Luke reassures her.\n\n“It’s fine… you look tired, go to sleep”\n\n“Like you’re not?”\n\n“Trust me, i’m a lot more of a night creature than you think i am, i can run on an hour of sleep”\n\n“That's not healthy”\n\n“Well i’m alive, so might as well… go to sleep, i won’t be long”\n\nHe closed the door and went to Eryn’s room. Her door has a small hole on it, he peeks through it and sees her sitting on her bed, reading something under a dim lantern’s light. It looks almost like a spell book, but he's pretty sure he has seen her write something on it, it might be a diary.\n\n“Ehm…”\n\nHe knocked on the door once, and the response came quickly.\n\n“Hello Luke, what's the matter?”\n\n“I just got into a brawl, just wanna check on this wound real quick”\n\n“Oh dear… come inside”\n\nShe seems equally worried as Vina is, but the check up was very fast, just a few minutes. She sighed in relief and gave him the good news.\n\n“it’s still holding up, don't worry”\n\n“Nice…”\n\n“Say, I woke up because I heard a commotion, a loud one… and I couldn't get myself to sleep again, do you know anything about it?”\n\n“I caused it”\n\nHe answered, ever so casually. Eryn’s expression turned to one of concern.\n\n“I… heard people screaming… uhm…”\n\n“I was just handing in that ring, got Vina with me, when we got there we met up with this dragon lady”\n\n“Drag- what? You mean Draconian?”\n\n“But she’s big! Like a-”\n\nLuke suddenly remembered that Eryn doesn't know what he is or where he’s from.\n\n“Like… that… yeah, big… horns… long neck”\n\n“Ah… a True Draconian, so what happened?”\n\n“She’s a criminal apparently, a magical one at that, took the ring and used it, said something about her being immune to the effect, and made a bunch of money demons come running out”\n\n“A curse spill?!”\n\nShe looked extremely concerned now.\n\n“Something like that, do you know anything about it?”\n\n“Not a lot… but assuming you stopped her… which you did… right?”\n\n“Yeah, Vina took the ring, handed it to me, a little cat and mouse… it’s a long story…. but basically, we won, and she’s in jail now”\n\nShe sighed in relief, caressing her chest as she did. That curse spill must be way more dangerous than he initially thought.\n\n“Thank goodness, curse spills are exponential in effect, the whole town could be overrun by demons in mere minutes, and I assume they take the form of objects of wealth?”\n\nLuke didn't really know how to respond to that information, he's just silently thankful that Vina quickly took action.\n\n“Yeah… my damn lunch money bit my toes”\n\n“What maniac would wear a cursed item knowing they're resistant?”\n\n“She’s one apparently… she’s got a long ass list of crimes, took the guards a few minutes just to recite it, now she's in bars for the next 200 years”\n\n“Just that?”\n\n“200 years is just that?”\n\n“According to the laws of the council of Magaea, exploitation of a cursed item that results in loss of life is punishable by death”\n\n“Hmm… fair”\n\nHe was suddenly interested in that council thing, sounds like magic stuff, and he did want to try magic.\n\n“Hey… off topic, but what is it like to use magic?”\n\n“Do you want to learn?”\n\n‘*Is she clairvoyant??*’\n\n“I was about to ask that next….”\n\n“If you want to use it, you should know the basics of… everything”\n\n“Huh?”\n\n“It depends highly on what you want to use, it isn't just a simple movement or chanting, one must know the very base workings of the objects that their magic effects”\n\n“So like… what? Any examples?”\n\nShe cleared her throat and lifted a finger while smiling, a certain image flashed before Luke's eyes that almost made him burst out laughing, thankfully he still has dignity.\n\n“My magic, for example, to grow things means I must know why plants even grow, how they grow, when… and where… a berry bush is best suited for a forest, if i try to do it in an open field, it’ll be much harder, possible… but quite a hassle”\n\n“So do you need to know that plants need water and other stuff to use nature magic?”\n\n“For the most part, yes”\n\n“So… say I want to use…”\n\nLuke tried to think of a magic he could use, maybe elemental would be best. He decided to ask about electricity, but this time he wisened up and said lightning.\n\n“What about lightning?”\n\n“That would be difficult, lightning is… hardly studied, scholars only know that they come during storms, when there are clouds, people have used it i heard… and no doubt it's powerful, as a single strike could cleave trees in half”\n\n“Well… let's just say I know a little more about lightning… Could I use it?”\n\n“Of course, anyone can learn magic, easy to learn, the more you know about something the stronger the magic related to that thing is, but-”\n\n“Hard to master?”\n\n“Indeed, if you want to use it to help in your line of work… then i recommend water or something simple, magic of any type can be very volatile if handled incorrectly, water is the least dangerous of the… combat capable magic, to put it in a certain way”\n\n“Is there anything that could help? Like…”\n\nLuke remembered that rune store thing he saw, he wondered how those worked. \n\n“...Runes?”\n\n“Ah… those, those are quite recent inventions, those make casting much easier, but there's a problem with them”\n\n“What is that?”\n\n“When one uses magic, they use something called mana, more mana used, the more powerful… and dangerous, using too much can lead to exhaustion, internal injuries, and death… learning to cast magic yourself trains you how to manage how much you spend… but runes… they can't regulate that, in fact, it makes it harder”\n\nLuke tried to visualize it in his head, to give it an analogy. If his body is like a jug and mana is water, would doing it himself means he gets a measuring cup to pour the water, but runes are pumps? Maybe.\n\n“I know about mana… a bit, but… how do they work exactly?”\n\n“It’s all around us, even inside, as we live, we gather it… we can't see it, but we can use it to manipulate the world around us… which leads most scholars to believe the very world itself is held together by mana, considering one can die if they use it excessively…”\n\n“What about mana crystals?”\n\n“Those often form in places that are high in mana concentration, which is to say… not a lot of places, mana is distributed equally all around the world, for the very few exceptions of course”\n\n“Hmm… I do want to try my hands at runes, what do you think?”\n\n“As i said before, it has its ups and downs, it’ll be much easier for you to cast magic, but it can make you spend too much mana”\n\n“Eh… i guess using it as a beginner crutch is fine”\n\n“If that's what you want… sure! Do consult with me, as this sounds like your very first time”\n\nShe gave him a warm smile.\n\n“It is, hopefully i don't fry myself”\n\n“Do practice patience and focus then, they'll in help toning down how volatile magic can be”\n\n“Right… thanks Eryn, i’ll get going now”\n\n“Happy to help!”\n\nHe stood up, bid her good night and left. As he closed the door, he yawned and grumbled.\n\n“Man… what a night”\n\n—-~----\n\nLuke woke up to the sound of a blade being sharpened, aggressively, he might add. with weary eyes and sore muscles he sat up. Then immediately as he was yawning he was hit on the nose with the hilt of a dagger.\n\n“Wait-wait! Don't kill me! I’m-”\n\n“Sorry, didn't see you”\n\n“Heh?”\n\nIt was Vina, she’s sitting next to him, sharpening stone in one hand, dagger in another. \n\n“Jeez, I thought someone was going to kill me, watch it next time girl… *yawn* what time is it?”\n\n“Very early in the morning… i’m surprised you're up already”\n\nShe sounds strangely nervous.\n\n“Yeah well, you ain’t exactly quiet… whatever, no going back to sleep now”\n\n“I’ll go back to sleep if i were you… we have nothing to do today”\n\n“You’re still in bed, and last I checked you’re you, so why don't *you* go back to sleep?”\n\nShe hesitated for a moment, she avoided eye contact with him and just shrugged.\n\n“I’m busy”\n\n“Ah-hah! But you said there's nothing to do today!”\n\n“Hmph… whatever Luke…”\n\nShe rolled her eyes while smiling.\n\n“Hmm… ya know? There is something to do today, at least for me”\n\n“And that is…?”\n\n“Magic!”\n\n“What?”\n\n“Oh come on… you promised, the rune store?”\n\nShe sighed, massaging her forehead. It's become a habit at this point.\n\n“Sure-”\n\n“WOOO!!!”\n\nLuke jumped out of the bed, as violently as one can, dressed up in record time, and ran out the door just as Vina stood up.\n\n“Wha- wait for me!”\n\n—-~----\n\nAs it turns out, Luke did wait for Vina. Downstairs by the inn’s front door. he did not remember the way to the rune store. After a little scolding by Vina, she got him to eat breakfast first before doing anything.\n\nEven after what happened last night Luke was still very giddy to go. She wondered, is this what taking care of a pup is like? Exhausting? If so, she’s not looking forward to having a mate.\n\n“Here it is…”\n\n“Oh yeah… it *was* through that street, how did I forget?”\n\n“You’re an idiot Luke, that's why”\n\n“Hey!... That hurts…”\n\nVina frowned, she seemed genuinely sad.\n\n“*Sigh* sorry… i'm-”\n\n“Jumpy from yesterday still?”\n\n“Yeah…”\n\n“Well… not everyday you gotta deal with a crazy dragon lady and money demons, i get it, just… chill, all i got to say”\n\n“What does that mean? Chill? I’m not cold?”\n\n“it means relax, don't think about it, yesterday’s rough but it’ll get rougher if you keep rubbing on it… it’s not like sharpening a sword, get it?”\n\nHe winked, hoping she got his reference to what happened this morning, she didn't catch it. In fact, she looked… even sadder, clearly contemplating about something.\n\n‘*must be her mood swings again*’\n\n“Hey uh… should we get inside?”\n\n“Sure… But don't-”\n\nHer tone raises, only to drop back down immediately, weird.\n\n‘*This girl ain't right in the head*’\n\n“-don’t overspend… i’ll wait here”\n\n“Will do… you sure you don't want one though?”\n\n“I don't know anything about magic Luke, no need”\n\n“Oh-kay….”\n\nLuke found her expression concerning, he’s not a psychologist, but he can tell she’s repressing something. He’s seen it before, not on her, but someone else, someone he knows very well, well… maybe not so much now. \n\n“*Sad girl September i guess*”\n\nHe whispered to himself as he walked in. The interior of the shop is… something, if there's a word for it, it’s eccentric, and maybe… hippie.\n\n“Hmm…”\n\nMagic trinkets hanging everywhere, evidently magical lanterns giving the place moody violet lighting. The floor is waxy for some reason…? There's also a flamboyant looking Draconian, standing behind a counter, looking at him with a smile he couldn't quite put a finger on what It means.\n\n“Welcome~”\n\nApparently a guy. He has nose and horn piercings, his fingers are full of rings and his arms are adorned with many bracelets. \n\n“Hey uhm…. Do you do runes?”\n\n“That's my specialty. Yes, what do you need, hot stuff?”\n\n‘*man… good thing social media conditioned me for this*’\n\n“Look, if you wanna flirt, at least do it *after* you do what i pay for?”\n\nHe leaned on the counter, his purple scales reflecting the dim colored light rather beautifully.\n\n“The impatient kind? My favorite… ehm… excuse me, been a bit lonely, what kind of rune do you want?”\n\n“*I can tell*”\n\n“Hmm?”\n\n“Nothing, so what kinda runes you got?”\n\n“Everything, I'm the best carver around here!”\n\nThe Draconian said with quite the confidence, Luke's skepticism kicked in.\n\n“Top fish eh? In a town like this?”\n\n“I enjoy the peace and quiet”\n\n“With a horde of undead at our doorstep it ain’t gonna be quiet for long, just saying”\n\n“True, I already considered moving, but until then… pick your poison~”\n\nHe gave Luke a small notebook and opened it to the runes section. It seems to be a catalogue of sorts. The Draconian flipped through the pages seamlessly, Luke might add, like a magician unfurling a stack of cards.\n\n“Gonna kill me or something?”\n\n“Not all runes are made equal, some of them more volatile than others… so… pick carefully, is what I'm saying”\n\n“Are you going to tell me which one can explode in my face?”\n\n“No”\n\nThe Draconian smirked.\n\n“Why?”\n\n“Because I don't know which one you know well enough to make it not explode on your face darling…”\n\n“Fair enough...”\n\nHe browsed through the catalogue, nothing of much interest to him, as they're all pretty basic. A lot of them are also expensive, one gold for most of them. A single rune in the last page caught his eye, yellow in color, made up of sharp shapes complimented with what looks like a symbol for clouds. It's cheap, only 300 silver.\n\n“Why is this one so cheap?”\n\n“Oh? That one? It’s a lightning rune, lightning is very dangerous, and-”\n\n“Not studied much?”\n\n“Indeed, you’re a smart one~”\n\nLuke thought about it, lightning is hard to use because no one in this world really understands how it works right? He’s not a genius, but he does know how lightning works, so maybe it could work out for him.\n\n“I’ll take it”\n\nThe Draconian seems confused.\n\n“Are you sure? Its-”\n\n“I'm sure, just give it to me, and put it on this”\n\nHe placed his axe on the counter.\n\n“Mhmm… unconventional choice, but alright~ I’ll warn you though, this rune is dangerous… It'd be a shame for someone like you to die from such an-”\n\n“i’ll pay 300 extra”\n\n“Deal!”\n\nThe flirtatious look and coy smile disappeared, replaced by a smile you’d expect to come from a salesman.\n\n‘*Is this guy a con artist?*’\n\n“Deal… how long will it take?”\n\n“Not too long, take a seat and enjoy some-”\n\n“I’ll wait outside”\n\nLuke walked out nonchalantly.\n\n“...Tea”\n\n—-~----\n\n“You’re done already?”\n\nVina asked, she’s sitting on a bench just across the shop, sharpening her dagger again for some reason. Maybe he should ask her about that.\n\n“Nah, i'm just gonna wait out here while he works on it”\n\n“What did you get?”\n\nShe asked as he sat down next to her.\n\n“Lightning rune”\n\n“Lightning? You mean those bright and loud branches that come out of the sky?”\n\n“Yeah”\n\nShe smiled, and looked at the cloudy yet sunny sky.\n\n“My people believed… well, used to believe… that clouds are living beings, they say that storms happen because the clouds are curious about what's on the ground and when they touch it, its hands are the lightning we see… silly, isn't it?”\n\n“Sounds pretty cool honestly, but whatcha mean used to?”\n\n“Back when I was little, I heard those stories from my elders, but when I asked the adults about it, only a few of them knew. Most of them just… laughed it off, things changed i suppose…”\n\nLuke thought about it for a second, he's reminded of his own family. His family has always been culturally thick, been so for generations, but it would be a lie to say that it didn't fade out when it comes to his turn to pass it down. He regrets it deeply to this day.\n\n“Sounds like the culture’s got washed thin eh? Well… you’re an adult now, you should share that to young people so it lives on”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“It sounds silly, yeah, but like… losing something like that is just bad you know? Culture? it's like forgetting the past… and you know what they say about learning from the past”\n\n“I guess… you’re right”\n\nLuke nodded in response. He’s a bit surprised, even in a world like this, in this kind of time period, something like that could happen. \n\n“Yeah, just don't let it fade to obscurity, even stuff like that… hey, isn't that…?”\n\nSomething caught his eye, or someone really. It's one of those dragon people, true Draconians or something. It's the black scaled dragon guy who arrested that dragon witch last night, he's part of the town’s guard force.\n\n“What? That Draconian?”\n\n“Yeah, he’s the one at the tavern right?”\n\n“Maybe, what of it?”\n\nLuke’s been thinking about something, it's been in the back of his mind since last night. That dragon witch, Sylvia or whatever, must be really mad at him. Knowing her history of jailbreak, he worried that she might actually break out and come back to one up him, as in kill him.\n\n“We kinda made ourselves an enemy last night… so-”\n\n“She’s in jail Luke”\n\n“Not for long if you ask me, have you heard of her records?”\n\n“I did, but i don't think-”\n\n“I’ll ask him for protection, I'm not looking forward to getting fried”\n\n“What? Hey- wait! Luke!... *Sigh…*”\n\nHe walked up to the true Draconian, he looks a lot bigger up close, though his face is nothing like the dragon lady, a lot softer. He noticed Luke coming up on him and gave him a flat greeting followed by a small nod.\n\n“Citizen…”\n\n“What's up dude, you the guy who arrested that witch last night?”\n\n“Yes… and you…”\n\nHe seems to realize something.\n\n“Ahh… the hero… the guard force appreciates your bravery last night, thank you for taking care of that curse spill for us”\n\n“Yeah… but the tavern’s ashes now, so not really, haha… anyway, got a name?”\n\n“Drako Ashborne, and you?”\n\n“Call me Luke, can I ask you something?”\n\nDrako nodded, he didn't seem to be bothered by Luke, he looked bored if anything.\n\n“So like… last night, I've been thinking right? And… well I'll just say it straight, I'm a bit scared that she's gonna break out and… y’know?”\n\nHe made a neck slash gesture.\n\n“I’m just asking if you protect us if something like that happens, truth is I'm kinda scared you know?”\n\n“Us?”\n\n“Yeah, me and that girl over there, we were at the tavern last night”\n\nLuke points at Vina, who is already back into sharpening her dagger again.\n\n“Hmm…”\n\nDrako seems to be thinking about something, judging from how his eye is moving. It's a bit weird, Luke thought.\n\n“I can assure you, your safety is guaranteed, she has been placed in a cell that not even a True Draconian can break out of, and we have special chains on her that should nullify her magic, you are safe”\n\n“Oh really? Hah! Guess I'm safe then… *hrmm…*”\n\nLuke is suddenly suspicious. There's something about Drako’s tone, even if it's really flat, that he doesn't like whatsoever.\n\n“Indeed, now if you excuse me, I must go to the southern gate”\n\nDrako left without another word, Luke kept his eye on him as he walked away. Good thing he did, as he caught Drako throwing a small glance at him.\n\n“.....”\n\n“Why are you just standing there Luke?”\n\nVina called out to him. \n\n“Egh…”\n\nHe walked up to her and whispered, while pointing at the general direction Drako went.\n\n“*Do you think he's a bit weird?*”\n\n“What's so weird?”\n\n“*I don't know, his mannerisms I guess, I don't like the way he talks, he moves just fine I guess… but I really don't like the way he talks*”\n\n“I suppose he is a bit too… stiff?”\n\n“*Right? Like he’s reciting some standard shit, probably standard police lingo or something*”\n\n“What's lingo? And pol… huh?”\n\n“*I’ll explain later, for now though…*”\n\nThe flamboyant Draconian guy walked out of his store and called out to Luke.\n\n“Yuhuuuu! Your rune is finished!”\n\n“...I'll just fetch my axe”\n\n—-~----\n\n“Are you sure you want that?”\n\nVina asked Luke as they ascended the stairs of the inn. Luke is busy touching his axe over and over again, he's been doing it since they left the rune store. Apparently he ‘likes the sensation’.\n\n“Yup… ow, uh-huh… ow”\n\n“Mmm… you should ask Eryn how to use it”\n\n“Yeah that's… ow, my plan”\n\n“See you soon I guess…”\n\nShe walked to their room, leaving him alone with his thoughts. He looked at Eryn's room, the door is slightly ajar. He walked up to it and knocked a few times, the answer came in the form of a yawn followed by a weak voice.\n\n“*Come in…*”\n\nHe opened the door, and saw Eryn sitting on her bed. Her eyes are baggy and her clothes are all messed up.  \n\n“Did you just wake up?”\n\n“Mhmm… *Yawn…*”\n\nShe responded as she rubbed her eye.\n\n“Uh… sorry to interrupt, but… I just… got a rune, so can I…”\n\n“Sure… just come in”\n\n“Alright…”\n\nHe got inside and closed the door. Eryn's room is actually really simple. Even more so than his room since it only has a bed, a table and nothing else, not even a chair. He resorts to sitting on the floor, as sitting next to her on the bed feels inappropriate.\n\n“Why are you…”\n\n“It's fine”\n\n“Oh… hmm… *Yawn…* So what rune did you get?”\n\n“Lightning!”\n\n“AHH!”\n\nHe happily exclaimed and whipped out his axe, accidentally firing a small bolt of lightning at the roof. It burned a small hole on the roof, scaring Luke and left Eryn holding her chest in shock.\n\n“Oh shit-”\n\n“Luke! Oh… my heart…! don't do that!”\n\n“Accidental discharge! I didn't mean to!”\n\nThe door to her room slammed open, it's Vina, she looks worried.\n\n“Are you two okay?!”\n\nLuke gives her a thumbs up.\n\n“Yeah!”\n\n“No!”\n\nEryn added in, Vina seems to be more convinced by Eryn's statement.\n\n“Did you do something stupid?”\n\nShe asked him with an accusatory tone.\n\n“Maybe…”\n\nVina seems unsurprised.\n\n“*Sigh…* be careful”\n\nShe closed the door, now it's just Eryn and Luke again, though now the air is awkward, it also smells like burnt wire.\n\n“Sorry about that… uh… can we…”\n\n“Y-yes… but please heed her words…!”\n\n“I will, so yeah! I got lightning”\n\nEryn calmed down and cleared her throat.\n\n“Ehm… that's… a choice, I thought I told you to get a water rune last night?”\n\n“Yeah but like… this is cooler”\n\n“Colder? It's not cold at all here, what are you talking about?”\n\n“I mean… stronger, I want something strong”\n\n“You could at least choose something I could help with…”\n\n“Oh, does that mean you can't help me?”\n\n“I can, but I will be very limited here, I don't know anything about lightning”\n\n“Yes! I mean… great! So how do we do this?”\n\nShe got up, only to sit back down on the floor in front of him. She cleared her throat and closed her eyes. Nothing happened for a moment, leaving Luke a bit confused. At least until a small tree branch sprouted from the wooden floor.\n\n“Woah! You can do that?”\n\n“Mhmm… now try doing it yourself”\n\n“Huh? Isn't this different?”\n\nHe points to his axe.\n\n“Just try… close your eyes and concentrate”\n\n“Okay…”\n\nHe followed her instructions, but even after some time, he didn't feel anything. \n\n‘*how the hell do you concentrate harder?*’\n\n“What I did there is that I channeled mana without control, however, as it has been manipulated by my mind… the mana is ‘tagged’ in a way, it's nature attuned mana now, so it goes to the nearest nature related object”\n\n“Ooh…”\n\n“Ah-ah-ah! Concentrate! No talking! Just listen…”\n\nHe nodded in response, it's not often that he immediately understands the gist of something. He's a bit proud of it, or maybe Eryn is just that good of a teacher, or perhaps he's just that stupid most of the time.\n\n“If you truly do understand the workings of lightning, then it shall show itself, question is… do you?”\n\nHe tries imagining it in his head, maybe that's how he can do it. Lightning, it's when the positives in the clouds really want to touch the negatives on the ground. He imagined it in his head, yet still feels nothing.\n\n“*Luke…?*”\n\nMassive amounts of electricity in the blink of an eye, enough power to give light to a house for a day straight. He imagined it again, yet he feels… nothing still.\n\n“*Luke*”\n\nAttracted to conductive objects, or anything tall enough, street lights, trees, lightning rods. He remembered that time when he was a kid where he purposefully stuck his dad's screwdriver to an electrical socket, now he feels… a slight tingle.\n\n“Luke!”\n\n“Huh?”\n\nLuke opened his eye to Eryn a bit further away from him, he immediately realized why when he saw his axe cosplaying a tesla coil.\n\n“Oh shit!”\n\nHe shook it around, the arcs of electricity coming off it immediately died down.\n\n“I’m so sorry!”\n\n“I-it’s fine… uhm… seems like, I have underestimated that rune… and your knowledge”\n\nThis must be that less control thing she talked about last night, maybe he should slow down a bit. Otherwise he’ll explode like a car battery, he thought, looking at the charred lines on the floorboard.\n\n“I suppose channeling lessons are not needed then, control lessons are high on the list however…”\n\n“Hehehe…”\n\nHe awkwardly laughed, as if he wasn't a living emp bomb a minute ago. Eryn stood up and returned to where she was in front of him, she smiled as she sat down.\n\n“It's quite uncommon to see someone capable of doing such a strong channeling already, even taking the rune into account, I felt a large amount of mana there”\n\n“I guess I knowing more about lightning than the average person has something to do with it”\n\n“Most likely, how do you know so much?”\n\nHe hesitated to answer. Not because he doesn't want to answer, he just hasn't come up with any new bullshit yet.\n\n“Uh… it's kind of… guesswork, mostly, I guess I'm just lucky”\n\n“Hmm…”\n\nHe's sweating, begging in his mind she doesn't see through it.\n\n“If that's the case, you should write it down and submit it to an academy! You could make history!”\n\nHe breathed a sigh of relief so deep Eryn thought he wanted to vomit.\n\n“Are you okay???”\n\n“Y-yeah…”\n\nHe gave her a thumbs up.\n\n‘*God damn*’\n\n—-~----\n\nNear the outskirts of Lannegar, a stone building stands tall, surrounded by dozens of guards. Most of these guards are taking a rest, with only some actually acting as a guard for the building. Those who have recovered now wait for others to finish their rotation, so they can take their place.\n\nA necessary system to keep the protectors of this town at their peak, or at least that's what the governor would say. Truth is exhaustion will gnaw away at one’s spirit regardless. It's not uncommon to see some guardsmen do a rotation first, wait for the second one to finish, skip the third rotation, and then finally go on the fourth one.\n\nIt's a fine system, works well enough, but sometimes it leaves a gap. A gap big enough that even a black scaled True Draconian can use it to sneak to the dungeon underneath unnoticed. \n\n“....”\n\nDrako stared at the worn bronze doorknob of the room he’s about to enter, the wear pattern on the doorknob matches the shape of his claw. He turned it clockwise, and opened the door to a sight he has seen a hundred times by now. \n\n“....Rrgh”\n\nA certain crimson and gold scaled Draconian snarled at him, he can only sigh in response. \n\n“You're late…”\n\nSylvia muttered under a puff of smoke, clear and deadly venom in her voice.\n\n“And you hit me… how dare you?”\n\n“I’m sorry, i needed to-”\n\n“DON'T TALK BACK TO ME!”\n\nShe shouted, her voice shook even the very chains holding her back, but Drako stood unaffected.\n\n“Now come here! And do what you're supposed to do!”\n\nDrako exhaled some white smoke from his nostrils before taking a step forward. Each step echoed through the dungeons, every prisoner here has heard it a thousand times.\n\n“Go on… don't waste my time”\n\nHe held up a key, a key that will unlock her cell and the chains that hold her in place. She stared at it with impatience, every second that passed serves to only make her angrier.\n\n“Finally…! You couldn't be any slower!”\n\nDrako unlocked the cell and walked in, it's always the same seven steps to reach her, the same seven thousand echoes that drive the other prisoners mad.  \n\n“Next time you hit me I will-”\n\nToday, something has to be different, and something different happened. He didn't release her immediately as he usually does, instead he grabbed her by the neck. With his claw sinking slightly in-between her scales, she struggled as she felt it cut her flesh.\n\n“Are you crazy-”\n\nHe cut her off with a snarl that matches her own, Sylvia is suddenly silent, now simply staring at his ash gray eyes. He let go of her neck a moment later, and unlocked her restraints in-between her gasps for air.\n\n“Haagh… someone's needy…”\n\nDrako dropped the key, it made an echo that he has heard a hundred times. Yet it was slightly muffled, muffled by the small drops of blood from Sylvia's neck.\n\n“Maybe you should learn how to not get caught…”\n\nHe uttered with a thick bitterness in his voice.\n\n“And miss my opportunity to do this?”\n\nShe grabs him by the horn, and pulls him in for a kiss. He didn't resist, as delighted as she would be if he did. She let go after a minute passed by, strings of saliva dripped into the splotches of blood on the floor, mixing together.\n\n“Hmph… I like it more when you resist…”\n\n“Get lost, I don't want to see your face”\n\n“Why not?~ Drako? Afraid we’ll get caught in the act?~”\n\nHe grabs her by the horn and pushes her against the wall, she cackles as he snarls in her face.\n\n“Now that's the Drako I know~ Hehehehaha….”\n\n“Hrrgh… get out of here, before I reach my limit”\n\n“Hmph… soon enough you’ll crave the feeling of my tongue against yours~ just like usu-”\n\nHe slapped her across the face and growled, she seemed genuinely surprised.\n\n“How dare you-”\n\n“How dare I? HOW DARE I? OH FOR THE LOVE OF- OF COURSE ITS ME! IT'S ALWAYS ME!”\n\nHe raised his voice to a degree she hasn't heard for a long time, she retaliated with similar ferocity, but it's far from equal.\n\n“WHO ELSE? WHO ELSE DECIDED TO LIVE LIFE LIKE A WEAKLING?!! WHO ELSE VIEWS HIMSELF AS THE ONE WHO CAN DO NO WRONG?!”\n\nBoth snarled at each other with a hidden anger that has been simmering for years, only now allowed to boil. \n\n“YOU THINK YOU'RE BETTER DRAKO? YOU THINK YOU'RE BETTER?!”\n\n“YES! BECAUSE I AM THE ONE WHO ALWAYS GETS YOU OUT OF TROUBLE!! I COULD HAVE LEFT YOU HERE TO ROT!”\n\n“I DON'T NEED YOU!”\n\nHe strikes, but stops just before his claws could maul her face. Her amber eyes reflect his bone white claws, a mere inch from blindness. She flinched in response, something that happens every once in a blue moon.\n\n“.....”\n\nSilence fills the room, anger heats up the air like always, but one can hear a pin drop.\n\n“Then do just that… because if this happens once again…”\n\nHe backed away slowly, and took out something tucked behind his armor, it's a necklace. A similar necklace graced Sylvia's neck with its silver shine, the amulet on both is in the shape of a wing.\n\n“...our marriage is over”\n\nHe let it go, the wing shaped amulet that would've fit perfectly with hers clanked against his armor, the echo of its sound cut Sylvia's ear like a dagger.\n\n“You can't do that-”\n\n“Shut up, I'm done listening to you… we could've lived a normal life, but you had to be you”\n\nHe tucked the necklace back in.\n\n“You wouldn't love me if I wasn't!”\n\n“Correct, and I realize now…”\n\nHe walked out of the cell, and trashed the room, trying to make it look like a fierce fight happened there.\n\n“...that it is the biggest mistake of my life, now get out…”\n\nHe walks out of the room, and crushed the knob as he slams the door shut.\n\n“...And get lost, Sylvia”\n\nShe waited for him to get far enough.\n\n“.....”\n\nSilence fills the room once again, and only silence persists as she bends the bars of her cell without touching them. Silence, as she fantasizes ripping the man who stole her ring and threw her in jail to shreds of flesh and sinew, that pest, the one who calls himself Luke.\n\n----~----\n\n[Next part](\n\nYeah I like dragons, how did you know?",

    "text_content": "[Demo: Extract from external text and screen capture](https://reddit.com/link/1mp44cu/video/3eqdo2ss3sif1/player)\n\n\n\n**Why I built this?** Calendars are still too manual. Most details live in emails, web pages, screenshots, and flyers. I wanted a private-by-design way to capture all of that in seconds—without retyping. I recently released an iOS/macOS app, but many users who are not using the Apple ecosystem asked for alternative solutions.\n\n**What it does:** Smart Calendars AI takes any text, image, or voice note and extracts calendar events or reminders within seconds. So you can paste an email thread, upload a screenshot of an event flyer, or just record myself saying \"dentist appointment next Tuesday at 2pm\" – and it parses everything into events I can edit and export to whatever calendar app I use.\n\n**Some things it handles that I find particularly useful:**\n\n\\- Takes any input — paste text, capture screen/tab, upload an image, or record a quick voice note (auto-transcribed).\n\n\\- Extract multiple events or reminders from a single prompt; finds all the dates/times in one go — meetings, classes, game nights, sessions…\n\n\\- Lets you tweak easily — change titles, times, locations, recurrence, reminders – either manually or by a follow-up prompt\n\n\\- Exports anywhere — download as ICS or send straight to Google, Apple, Outlook, or your reminder app (Things, Todoist, TickTick, etc.).\n\n\\- Supports complex recurring events and alarms\n\n\\- optional Chrome extension (Safari, Edge and Firefox will follow) for quick-capture — right-click text or images on a webpage → “Send to Smart Calendars AI” → it’s ready to edit/export.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n*\"Flight to Tokyo on Dec 5th at 10 PM. Remind me 2 days before at 8 PM to pack, and again 4 hours before the flight to leave.\"*\n\n*\"Advanced cooking class every Tuesday and Thursday evening at 7 PM, for the next 12 sessions.\"*\n\n*\"Yoga class every Tuesday and Thursday morning at 8 AM until the end of summer.\"*\n\nI recorded a quick 1-minute screen demo (no audio) so you can see it in action. Freemium (3 usages per month). I'd love to know if this sounds useful for your workflow, and what you'd want to see improved.  Are there specific calendar or task apps you'd want to see integrated?\n\n➡️ [https://report.smartcalendars.ai/web](https://report.smartcalendars.ai/web)\n\n➡️ [https://www.smartcalendars.ai/](https://www.smartcalendars.ai/)",

I was woken up by our cat at about 9:10 AM this morning and saw my alarm widget said there were no alarms. \n\nI open the app and lo and behold every single alarm is off. This has been happening quite frequently the last couple of weeks including right before I updated to iOS18.6 so it was also an issue with the version before iOS18.6. \n\nDoes this happen to anyone else and anyone have any suggestions to stop whatever this is?",

Say what you want, but when you're winning nothing else matters but the profits and gains. \n\n\n\n\n\n========================================\n\n✅ **SPY — 2025-08-13 (6:52:11 AM PDT)**  \nCurrent Price: **646.03**  \nDay Range: **644.49 → 646.19**  \nVolume: **6.33M**\n\n# 📊 Market Context\n\nSPY is trading **just above LP zone territory**, with heavy **call dominance** at multiple strikes immediately above and below price. Overnight/morning flow shows a **+438.78 surge in call strength** since the last snapshot, while put strength has dropped by **-115.66**. This represents a decisive bullish lean in early session positioning.\n\n# 📈 Totals Overview\n\n* **Call Strength:** 2,136.87 ⬆️ (+438.78)\n* **Put Strength:** 1,167.88 ⬇️ (-115.66)\n* **Call OI:** 93,597 ⬇️ (-3,742)\n* **Put OI:** 127,113 ⬆️ (+40,136)\n* **Call Vol:** 307,284 ⬆️ (+40,136)\n* **Put Vol:** 127,113 ⬇️ (-54)\n\nThe **volume delta** favors calls heavily, indicating aggressive bullish positioning despite elevated put open interest.\n\n# 📉 Trend Evolution\n\nFrom **6:49:41 AM → 6:52:11 AM**:\n\n* **Call Strength:** \\+438.78 surge\n* **Put Strength:** \\-115.66 drop\n* **strDiff (C-P):** \\+322.29 widening bullish gap Momentum shifted **further bullish** in less than 3 minutes — strong short-term acceleration.\n\n# 🎯 MP &amp; LP (Proportional Zones)\n\n**MP (Most Proportionate):** **645.00**\n\n* Ratio ≈ 0.97 → Balanced activity; potential short-term magnet.\n* In last snapshot: **645.00** as well — **MP unchanged**, confirming it as a consistent neutral pivot.\n\n**LP (Least Proportionate):** **646.00**\n\n* Ratio ≈ 6.31 → Heavy call imbalance; acts as resistance-to-target zone.\n* Last snapshot LP: **646.00** — **LP unchanged**, imbalance still extreme.\n\n✅ **Accuracy Check:** MP and LP both remain stable — market respecting yesterday’s proportional zones.\n\n# 🔮 Scenarios &amp; Forecast (6:52:11 AM)\n\n**Bullish Path:**\n\n* Sustained bids above 646.00 could ignite tests toward **647 → 648.00**.\n* LP acting as near-term magnet; a clean break can accelerate call-driven squeeze.\n\n**Bearish Path:**\n\n* Failure to hold **MP (645.00)** could invite pullback to **644.00** put wall.\n* Break under 644.00 likely accelerates toward 643.00 where put strength reappears.\n\n# 🧠 Interpretation\n\nThis is a **call-controlled tape** at the moment — call strength has surged sharply while put positioning has weakened. However, heavy put OI under price means dips will find strong defense. **Key battle is between 645.00 (MP) and 646.00 (LP)**.\n\n# 📌 Directional Outlook\n\nBias: **Bullish leaning**  \nConfidence: **High intraday**, moderate beyond first leg.  \nTriggers:\n\n* **Bull Break:** Above LP (646.00) with volume follow-through.\n* **Bear Check:** Below MP (645.00) with sustained pressure.\n\n# 👥 Traders’ Behavior &amp; Sentiment\n\n* **Bulls** 🟩: Aggressively adding calls near current price and OTM up to 650.00.\n* **Bears** 🟥: Holding ground at 644.00 and 643.00, but losing strength above 645.00.\n* Sentiment dynamic: **Momentum traders in control**, scalpers likely defending MP on dips.\n\n# 🔼 Call Side Breakdown\n\n|Strike|Call Strength|Notes|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|650.00|95.49|Light wall — far OTM.|\n|649.00|153.60|Building interest.|\n|648.00|165.45|Pre-breakout zone.|\n|647.00|495.80|Key resistance layer.|\n|**646.03**|**1241.67**|LP zone, largest imbalance.|\n|646.00|745.87|Secondary pressure.|\n|645.00|505.17|MP — balanced pivot.|\n|644.00|0.70|Weak calls, put heavy.|\n|643.00|\\-25.21|Bearish tilt here.|\n\n# 🔻 Put Side Breakdown\n\n|Strike|Put Strength|Notes|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|650.00|1.41|Minimal hedge.|\n|649.00|4.76|Very light.|\n|648.00|9.46|Weak.|\n|647.00|33.75|No major threat.|\n|**646.03**|**152.42**|Counterweight at LP zone.|\n|646.00|118.67|Moderate defense.|\n|**645.00**|**520.87**|Strongest put wall above 644.00.|\n|644.00|320.66|Major bear defense.|\n|643.00|158.30|Support layer.|\n\n  \n\n\n  \n",

The interface takes cues from retro adventure games but adds current-day quality-of-life features like autosaves, scalable UI for high-DPI and ultrawide screens, rebindable controls, accessibility options, and skippable transitions.\n\n**Core features:**\n\n* Pixel-perfect hotspots with contextual action menus (Examine / Use / Talk)\n* Keyboard + gamepad navigation\n* Modern retro look: CRT, bloom, letterbox (toggle per scene)\n* Inventory system + puzzle hooks\n* Data-driven rooms and interactions for fast iteration\n* Cross-platform: Win / Mac / Linux / Android\n* MIT-licensed\n\n⚠ **Status:** Heavily in development — currently **alpha** and updated frequently.

I am saying this not to take any sympathy but to show the actual condition of mine ! I posted this earlier but got lectured upon astrology is not for this silly things and all ! \n\nI just want to say if any way its possible I would like to know so that I would have that hope ! And the uncertainty of future would less affect me ! I would actually be able to focus more once I get to know it ! Trust me !

While the original Cosmos models focused on generating synthetic video data, the new Cosmos Reason takes a different approach — it's designed to actually understand what's happening in physical spaces and plan accordingly.\n\nThe latest releases include Cosmos Transfer-2 for faster synthetic data generation and a distilled version optimized for speed. But Cosmos Reason is the standout, promising to help robots and AI agents think through spatial problems like predicting when \"a person stepping into a crosswalk or a box falling from a shelf\" might happen.\n\nThis represents Nvidia's continued push into what it calls \"physical AI\" where they are trying to bridge the gap between AI that works well with text and images, and AI that can actually navigate and manipulate the real world. Robotics companies have been struggling with the expensive process of collecting enough real-world training data to make their systems reliable.\n\nCompanies like[ 1X, Skild AI, and others](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.929jZiiRht9qZPYC5Z_-teSzLBSf_0iauhguQ-NLnIvbn3lBCR30smWoEbzKJZ-WyUka0SfMJUCdBRl5WDHKgIQ_8RUIae0FoTnp17H2yj8t-IhkKaFW9On1BYE7SeeQx8Z8Wyhm9Y2-ZQp-5ivDe1C29jjqHgAI5EVLIGYEUG_nxIFXJzXBMuRAPrd1QYfxXIvJdbQeI5BD3NOR2fm6vl3GrgPcmYXQ0Lc28foH4GAiG3_xCYlq9orP_mWs35ukxOLt-r0Q7Pi9lHGwH_-5JljTQLYhaAyTFsffIibfLQiXZHdOFCDmcxa_T4bRtMnp2ravS5aD61GtCir6fPM4RqrYixrYtYgb1ABBauVUnwntXzG707yf7hHi5GOCcWdUw3U4oFAUmshXoTneW_OAbw/4iz/mea5FqgBThC194ay-sz2kQ/h26/h001.pKF_MaUTUIc_iquCuNxyHdaBrQ4TqB_HhejcMf5KC-A) are already testing Cosmos models, suggesting there's real demand for tools that can generate physics-aware synthetic data rather than forcing developers to film thousands of hours of robot footage.\n\nThe models are available through Nvidia's API catalog and can be downloaded from [Hugging Face](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.qNCZjjYQy9oQCZ7BSSPG-M40R4VPY45QdAKjwG_YMQHS3Xv5oN3w2TS4s0t9oauGcDGluVqFz8NLHU_waPt3WeF34nIPBins1tUxhSqoAUdcLfvPSY-ADGWfkB_lNleBbkkUEOEwxEXy2ydBD8-QaX2nFU1__sQJbEGQrmIfClGS4qFlAPRbtkpW-jTnnPT7KkJgylYX44gf0ro8kKdd2jyQIDVtvHJzcJ9nk5Ppfi5r-zGVFpSpaNVZh5VhyNHj9lZTwEnjgQALt22TFpbvmw/4iz/mea5FqgBThC194ay-sz2kQ/h27/h001.jl77PyeGucVJ3sVZIIta5TxDtAERP7FUPwbJvv3mWUo), continuing the company's strategy of making advanced AI infrastructure accessible while positioning itself as the essential platform for the next wave of robotics development.\n\n\n\n# 🛑 China urges firms not to use Nvidia H20\n\n* Chinese authorities are discouraging local companies from using Nvidia’s H20 chips, demanding firms justify orders over domestic alternatives and raising questions about potential hardware security issues.\n* Officials in Beijing are worried the processors could have location-tracking and remote shutdown capabilities, a specific concern that Nvidia has strenuously denied in recent statements to the press.\n* The government's push also targets AMD's MI308 accelerators as part of a wider state-led effort to develop homegrown semiconductor capabilities and reduce reliance on Western technology.\n\n# 🧠 Meta’s AI predicts brain responses to videos,\n\nMeta’s FAIR team just [**introduced**](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.6k0_SAz8nrOuu_-LoNX1Ha_P2AeSK-zqDihiqefKUPJ1A4px-JhkIH570mvYMcg-YRD-Xu5Acf8UHA-q0a1YFtxZ-A2BdSnjzKUq1-AwyXFPMVoXoT4qcCvfk-VuHfFN65YqwM7uyRYDTHWLGa3Z1vbMhAOo4nXuh5CdXGQUYz0Qli-8juJxtcx3HNJypEz4YqWqm8K8lQZSi-lAMzo4FCM11saEDIYkt-b0_i8FB53kImvNuwqYYCm3mBoIR4_zLaybSk4rH6MOt3FGlD_w_g/4iz/P_mNAVcDQOi6qh17J_JFxA/h7/h001.zfmJ0WX81wvrtskol2bDozyv_tk2A9hYDufhhA1FUGk) TRIBE, a 1B parameter neural network that predicts how human brains respond to movies by analyzing video, audio, and text — achieving first place in the Algonauts 2025 brain modeling competition.\n\n**The details:**\n\n* TRIBE analyzes video, audio, and dialogue from movies, accurately predicting which of the viewer’s brain regions will activate without any brain scanning.\n* The AI correctly predicted over half brain activity patterns across 1,000 brain regions after training on subjects who watched 80 hours of TV and movies.\n* It works best in brain areas where sight, sound, and language merge, outperforming single-sense models by 30%.\n* Meta's system also showed particular accuracy in frontal brain regions that control attention, decision-making, and emotional responses to content.\n\n**What it means:** We’ve only uncovered the tip of the iceberg when it comes to understanding the brain and its processes, and TRIBE and other AI systems are ramping up that knowledge. But they are also providing new formulas for maximizing attention on a neural level, potentially making doomscrolling even more irresistible.\n\n# 🏅 OpenAI's reasoner snags gold at programming olympiad\n\nOpenAI [**announced**](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.6k0_SAz8nrOuu_-LoNX1HaSIRI5hsnO_wp34T44KIz6-H34vwfUtR_AF405dy_4Al_oY8J6TRUO4CXzt-TSJiCvDdnnSEduqakX3S9BakIzQ8v0xPrgVqrefepktFcSGUmrocB0Q-F2d_pEkaiIw34Qrtqsn3QTzjpYUt7nvXemsRKpwhfMl20wD1wke9CKJD9ARLd3nGmaEY_BuH0lz_uRC3-HC9ahkpHEnwKQXKawCXv-l9jQ8tcW5KlZSfd40pi5fwQO3bF-rhLadAKlPNA/4iz/P_mNAVcDQOi6qh17J_JFxA/h13/h001.-AJzKI8qwEy5s_UTYxyQIh97rdxTEu1aZHOQ0zQLPRo) that its reasoning model achieved a gold-level score at the 2025 International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI), placing 6th against humans and first among AI in the world’s top pre-college programming competition.\n\n**The details:**\n\n* The AI competed against top student programmers worldwide, solving coding problems with the same time and submission limits as human contestants.\n* OpenAI’s model was a general-purpose reasoner, without specific fine-tuning for programming and relying on just basic tools.\n* The system scored in the 98th percentile, a massive jump from a 49% score just a year ago.\n* The same model also won gold at the International Math Olympiad and AtCoder, showing strength across a range of complex problem-solving areas.\n\n**What it means:** The 2x leap in score shows how fast reasoning capabilities have truly moved over the past year. The days of humans ahead of AI in competitions are numbered, and these achievements will likely be the stepping stones towards future models that are capable of discovering new science, math, physics, and more.\n\n\n\n# 💊 Korean researchers’ AI designs cancer drugs\n\nResearchers at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science &amp; Technology (KAIST) [**developed**](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.dSnm3kaGd0BkNqLYPjeMfxihQCl5g2YxDMYMm0AMA8rBgrbnteAOhFux9Gv8LTEYYr-uLuSA9jFzxQM_KC-8ss1sZnZg0VPypcd5t9ehgDMpAfCuPxQ-Ssvb6fTsAaNndlWfXKELSreRYL31Ndqu3GEeVNdDOVVxl6jN9plMgOZNbMhupWQIexqmC1NHb2tm4WWzZaPlVATdLtWYcyliUnEs7PH5kFGGWC5p_DD6qtiI2FXDPIL-8sM-6o1RhvAeajEgWUwECAIcw0RBJIgYaFCcN_xb3CJLyzuVBtvOK_NEkGjt1ju1YZdT0aA-W8QgGzoNFShQeA3yVRZOSdHfLp5_YiX85TZyhOKQUjVMjzxFVSvqIWhsvsLANwFrJzZuT_kG19V2pn4NzK5T5urHWA/4iz/P_mNAVcDQOi6qh17J_JFxA/h21/h001.JzPqLV1q7NBgnfeanTu9QWb03MIRN63yleK8mEa4DoQ) BInD, a new diffusion model that designs optimal cancer drug candidates from scratch without any prior molecular data or training examples.\n\n**The details:**\n\n* The AI designs both the drug molecule and how it will attach to diseased proteins in one step, rather than creating and then testing in multiple iterations.\n* BInD created drugs that target only cancer-causing protein mutations while leaving healthy versions alone, showing precision medicine capabilities.\n* Unlike older AI systems that could only optimize for one criterion at a time, BInD ensures drugs are safe, stable, and possible to manufacture all at once.\n* The model also learns from its successes, reusing winning strategies with a recycling technique to design better drugs without starting from scratch.\n\n**Why it matters:** Drug discovery continues to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of AI acceleration. While the first AI-designed drugs are just starting to come to market, it feels like we’re only a few steps away from the floodgates opening on humanity-altering medicine advances designed by advanced AI models.\n\n\n\n# 🤖 xAI Makes Grok 4 Free Globally, Days After GPT-5 Launch\n\nElon Musk’s company xAI has made its AI model Grok 4 freely accessible to users around the world for a limited time—a tactical move closely following OpenAI’s GPT-5 release.

The culprit? Inconsistency. Even with DeepThink reasoning boosts, these systems are elite in some domains and embarrassingly brittle in others. Sundar Pichai’s AJI label is now the polite way to say “brilliant idiot.”\n\n**How this hits reality:** AJI isn’t a half-step to AGI—it’s a chasm. Closing it means more than shoving GPUs and data at the problem; it requires breakthroughs in reasoning, planning, and memory. For teams betting on near-term AGI, this is a [**cold shower**](https://aisecret.us/r/a94df255?m=75fe0f74-46b6-4618-9375-07821bf777c6): your “almost there” model may still hallucinate its way out of a paper bag.\n\n**Key takeaway:** AGI isn’t just “more AJI”—it’s a different beast. And right now, the beast is missing teeth.\n\n# Claude’s Memory Goes Selective—And That’s the Point\n\n**What’s happening:** Anthropic rolled out a “search-and-reference” memory for Claude, letting users pull past chats on demand. It works across devices, keeps projects siloed, and never builds a persistent user profile. Unlike OpenAI’s always-on memory, Claude won’t “remember” unless [**explicitly asked**](https://aisecret.us/r/c029a694?m=75fe0f74-46b6-4618-9375-07821bf777c6) — no silent data hoarding, no surprise callbacks.\n\n**How this hits reality:** For enterprise buyers and compliance teams, Claude’s opt-in recall is a feature, not a bug. It sidesteps privacy backlash, keeps audit trails clean, and reduces the risk of unintentional behavioral profiling. OpenAI’s default-on approach gives richer personalization but also a bigger [**regulatory attack surface**](https://aisecret.us/r/354b005a?m=75fe0f74-46b6-4618-9375-07821bf777c6). In a market already twitchy about AI “overfamiliarity,” Anthropic just handed security teams an easy win.\n\n**Key takeaway:** Claude remembers only when told — turning “forgetfulness” into a trust moat OpenAI can’t claim.\n\n# Grok 4’s Chess Loss Is a PR Bloodbath for Musk\n\n**What’s happening:** While Elon Musk was busy telling Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella on GPT-5 launch day that OpenAI would “[**eat Microsoft alive**](https://aisecret.us/r/f75925be?m=75fe0f74-46b6-4618-9375-07821bf777c6),” his own LLM, Grok 4, was being eaten alive — 4–0 — by OpenAI’s o3 in a live-streamed Google Kaggle AI chess showdown. The kicker? Five-time world champion Magnus Carlsen was live on mic, laughing, face-palming, and likening Grok’s blunders to “kids’ games” and club amateurs who only know openings.\n\n**How this hits reality:** Forget Kaggle rankings — this was a [**marketing assassination**](https://aisecret.us/r/992e86e5?m=75fe0f74-46b6-4618-9375-07821bf777c6). In an arena meant to showcase AI prowess, Grok’s collapse gave OpenAI a free highlight reel of dominance, complete with the world’s best chess player laughing at Musk’s flagship model. In a hype war where perception is product, Grok 4 just took a branding loss it can’t spin.\n\n**Key takeaway:** In AI chess, as in AI marketing, one bad night can hand your rival a year’s worth of victory ads.\n\n# What Else Happened in AI on August 12th 2025?\n\n**Chinese AI lab Z AI** [**released**](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.siHJl2oxYc5G1hfeCOvt3e9nIxabv3onLCOtgHJhDn4VrrYCgsXHJhAu9Bi1jYiXiHPqHYYiLLGhNJRTtgDZsSITL8zkGgJiWgBDr0Sr0TY49OII2LAF_Zboc86h9XYYmPzNZa8IJD6i_y60MEf9oWkiQWFtgEkGLHdKNBemGLWD0HhSgTkYdrRExuNF4CSt3gcJLxoS8InQ6mn8WuFNKcRfc7FtP9x8nJUS-eF7Uef6ZaZnetpd1a8GCXM2T_Vg/4iz/P_mNAVcDQOi6qh17J_JFxA/h28/h001.zVEO2jGLSYBlrArTgzDV8zHgLqKyOMSBFpkli6F0kC0) GLM-4.5V, a new open-source visual reasoning model that achieves top scores on over 40 different benchmarks.\n\n**GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke** [**announced**](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.6k0_SAz8nrOuu_-LoNX1HcwduSS0zPmX09KBZjjx3ZzBs4ymFGHXnKZaF1I3Nc727WjjeKDIEwHbwO8nO7UYSykouFgnso8qM07Wer51doPYFGz5cECYNtbTJqDeN-IkfcaWrHp8hTs1nuzHrdi0h6b82CAGr3vtXOyf-8KGc94gVdc7LWxoIWztNJVP5be6Dz00cPOuxcdcKRpggx4LsXtjXMkR2zAD_n79D90awZvsmqCbagyN4xMjc4mLBIchsV1h4W5oF_ez2JxObfFOJg/4iz/P_mNAVcDQOi6qh17J_JFxA/h29/h001.5jKcUTayRfPUMN_USOia7l5IhFDXH9Gao-edtU5D57c) that he is leaving the company to pursue his own startup, with GitHub now being woven into Microsoft’s CoreAI department.\n\n**The U.S. government** is reportedly [**set to enter**](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.dSnm3kaGd0BkNqLYPjeMfz3sRxipJonf99jMXlaKZFcHW4edPZxPRbycqkJl01kXThJXy1nVKoSknz1WL23movlxNbZodBw9R0oCfp40AS4qxPjIfFgU36vfZeTUQzgSOaFBHF_EpUBa0KzsZ1ym66rpbaMZoajgCBc_EpeZ33G9mMYSvpzdq9BST87mTTmjEDaQZKpfuTsOEqtMpdhfEXqaCiYlN6GE78krBlV1adAEQ4cS8L3IJbUIBKDkeSWNsQriP3w32wpux6potMN9bUaKfE-DVynjUDtxNgtxgcie9vVY4Du6IeKwm0xqwwn_/4iz/P_mNAVcDQOi6qh17J_JFxA/h30/h001.2fTm1KUfe0ZTo14iZNf8ZOGdPuUXbCGPf7IIn81bXow) into a new agreement with chipmakers Nvidia and AMD that would provide a 15% cut of chip sales to China.\n\n**Pika Labs** [**introduced**](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.6k0_SAz8nrOuu_-LoNX1Heh_niAXJ2AISUQPGpp8W5eblJeN_OfiIlJbwMfiAxwcGy1gf59bcbctPaRifKY0IxAbiLUDmYzlfhzbEvVlR9IVeWOwrH2qX6iZnyYwa1neQ2af1gW1G71vN-2La9y4NtjD9CX5ZfuJHnCw2lY6PC_0wEjMqOK983Ws7uDcmedvN9hNWa1cM899PmW4syhnRTEnZdlVe-rki65Yj9Y0MQzIw_NxWQYf0lR9VfcTgz1XjBBaPg6j8eqyu9xUNI20gg/4iz/P_mNAVcDQOi6qh17J_JFxA/h31/h001.L7a386uqRUi0BUbmiblRxBgKR0LhP5taf703QRch_D0) a new video model rolling out to its social app, with the ability to generate HD-quality outputs with lip-sync and audio in six seconds or less.\n\n**Alibaba** [**announced**](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.6k0_SAz8nrOuu_-LoNX1HURA0_wGbBzO19ASQnIJuju3wk5b1WsW6OO0EKjtRDmPGSOqSNB9JZiTunUgEoW7nDeqOKbBj76B9Jau3rhQvHNyzbh3FPj8kfNCCtv63xzHfflIi712yfw5JVo6tO3GUhfT1X7aW62Fj1kWQf64GfeTWqpXTEaI3DSNeO5-D5sDqag1bVT2VCsXzMCDbBXTDq3JJEgIY8y2ga5OiouTht4Lj0Y_EQX1j7webyXU-VR8AWGec7443UljCeeFZp5JyQ/4iz/P_mNAVcDQOi6qh17J_JFxA/h32/h001.3stgqPsmkEg9sbLxXbZ5zshD3jGA-3OVqjGEhg6bbYs) that its Qwen3 models have been upgraded with ultra-long context capabilities of up to 1M tokens.\n\n**Anthropic** [**unveiled**](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.6k0_SAz8nrOuu_-LoNX1HRvW9VP5rEYS4Ejtilvh9TA0JDWsqrvJ-9sKCHsQtX_FHoSDMvGyj4o0EUzlASUlixPLlKisU2DZwR9KC8eXwoArP1FcMCgmv4AHMZ-C28lgdVlgzA3PHJTmM9YvXWiGdPCJWPzO0d7H2SSfG6rEcsG91pR1huu3ZARBp-56N3SBDHhszxHcpeWQn-l1hSh9OP-MLABp-EDrqt6HnLRcG3LBYuKjpOvAsSX14x6hrJY5stUzmCkmPKKkEYuDsJHT6g/4iz/P_mNAVcDQOi6qh17J_JFxA/h33/h001.5Q4lf5nOa8SIEOuhFJhbd0_v1uyqPPDqxD0x1FHpXAY) new memory capabilities in Claude for Max, Team, and Enterprise users (excluding the Pro tier), giving the ability to reference previous chats.\n\n# 🔹 Everyone’s talking about AI.
